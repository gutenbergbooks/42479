<center><h3>Editing Notes</h3>
</center>
<p>
Nelson's manuscript is a handwritten first draft for a work on North
American aboriginal belief systems, completed in June, 1823.  Nelson
had intended to edit and publish it at a later date. The first
publication did not occur until 1988 in <b>"The Orders of the
Dreamed": George Nelson on Cree and Northern Ojibwa Religion and Myth,
1823</b> where it is given a comprehensive, analytical and contextual
treatment by Jennifer Brown and Robert Brightman with contributions
from other authors.

<p>
The goals for this edition of Nelson's La Ronge Journal of 1823 are to
make his work accessible to a wider audience and ensure its preservation
and availability in digital format. It is presented here in three parts.
</p>

<p>
<b>Part 1</b> provides a lightly edited version of the manuscript.
Nelson's text is an excellent example of common English usage in early
nineteenth century North America. Idiosyncratic misspellings are
generally corrected; archaisms and localizations have been maintained.
Where the spelling of names is irregular or abbreviated, a consistent
spelling is chosen.  Punctuation has been somewhat modernized.
</p>

<p>Editorial interjections, including section and subsection headings not
in the original, are enclosed in brackets. Nelson occasionally used
brackets in the text for parenthetical remarks; these have
been replaced with braces.</p>

<p><b>Part 2</b> is a verbatim and line by line transcription of the
original handwritten document. The transcription serves as the
starting point for <b>Part 1</b>.  It is included here because of the
importance of the journal as an historical document and the desire to
preserve and make the manuscript available close to the original form
while moving it to a digital version. No attempt has been made to edit
or correct the text.
</p>

<p><b>Part 3</b> (omitted from the text-only and portable reader "noimage"
versions) is a set of digital images of the manuscript made from
photocopies provided by the Toronto Reference Library, the holder of
the Nelson papers.  The size of the images is reduced to make them
suitable for on-line use; resolution is kept adequate for direct
comparison with the transcription.</p>

<p>An added table of contents provides links (in the hypertext version)
to sections or pages in each of the three parts.  Page numbering
preserves that of the manuscript for reference purposes.</p>

<p>Certain sections of the this e-text may display poorly on some e-book
readers: (1) References to World Wide Web resources may be longer than
can be contained on normally formatted lines. To simplify correct
copying of the references, the lines have not been split. (2) In Part 2,
the line by line transcription, Nelson sometimes made additions or
corrections increasing the number of words on a line of text. The length
of the transcribed text line was increased to maintain the correspondence
between the manuscript and the e-text.</p>

<p>The Nelson manuscript was made available courtesy of the Toronto Public
Library. I would like to thank the staff of the Baldwin Room Manuscripts
Collection at Toronto Reference Library for their assistance in making
the material available for digitization. I would also like to express
thanks to my wife, Susan O'Donovan, for the hours spent proofing text
and clarifying many fine details of the language.</p>

<br>
<p>Nelson's experiences and accounts come from his life and work with
Ojibwa / Saulteau cultures around Lake Superior and Lake Winnipeg and
contact in his later career with the Cree of  Lake Winnipeg, the
Saskatchewan Delta, Cumberland House and Lake la Ronge.  He makes reference
to the Beaver Indians (Dane-zaa) who, until the nineteenth century,
lived as far east as the Slave and Clearwater Rivers bringing them and other
Athabaskan cultures into contact with fur trading at Ile à la Crosse,
the administrative centre for Nelson's post at Lake la Ronge.
</p>

<p>His journal of 1802/1803 was instrumental in leading to the
rediscovery of the Folle Avoine posts of the XY Company and North West
Company in 1969 by Harris and Frances Palmer with assistance of local
residents. Subsequent archaeological work was undertaken and the forts
were reconstructed and have been operated as the Forts Folle Avoine
Historical Park by the Burnett County Historical Society since
1989. The Society provides tours, displays and programs on the fur
trade and aboriginal culture of the area.</p>

<p>Nelson recalled accounts of Ojibwa practices in the Lake Superior area in
his 1823 La Ronge journal.<p>

Lake la Ronge was the site of some twenty trading posts dating from
1779. Nelson's Hudson's Bay Company post was a reestablishment in
1821 of an earlier North West Company post. According to
<u>The Atlas of Saskatchewan</u>, it was the only fort on the Lake
over the winter of 1822/1823. The location is likely a known
archaeological site in the area shown on the map identified in the
Atlas as Lac la Ronge II.

<p> The road network reached La Ronge, founded in the early 1900's, in
1947, and Stanley Mission, which dates from 1851, in 1978.</p>

<h3>Part 1</h3>

<h4 class="section"><a name = "s1" href = "#tocs1">[Introductory Remarks]</a></h4>
<p>The following few stories or tales will give a better notion or
idea of the religion of these people than every other
description <b><u>I</u></b> am able to pen. And as
their <u>history</u> is read with interest, I am persuaded these few
pages will be found equally deserving attention.  I give them the same
as I received them and leave every one to make his own remarks and to
draw his own conclusions.</p>


<h4 class="section"><a name = "s2" href = "#tocs2">[Conjuring: The Interpreter's Account]</a></h4>
<p>My interpreter, a young half breed, passed the winter of 1819-20
with the Indians and gives this account.  One day shortly before
Christmas, he was out with an elderly man, a chief of this place, a
hunting.  Suddenly he stopped as to <u>listen</u>, apparently with
great eagerness and anxiety, upon which, after allowing a sufficient
time, the interpreter asked what was the matter.

<p>"Listen and you'll hear." </p>

<p>"I have listened," says the interpreter, "but hear nothing, and it is
surprising that you who are deaf should hear and I not."</p>

<p>"Ah! A white man is thy father, and thou are just
as <u>skeptical</u>, doubting and ridiculing every thing we say or do
'till when it is then too late. Then ye lament, but in vain."</p>

<p>After this the Indian became much downcast and very thoughtful for
several days. And as if to increase his anxiety, or rather to
corroborate the husband's assertions, his wife said that one day she
also <u>heard</u>, though the other women that were with her heard
nothing, and an altercation ensued.</p>

<p>His uneasiness increasing too much, he was forced to have recourse
to <u>their</u> only alternative in such cases, <u>une Jonglerie</u>
as the French term it, that is conjuring. </p>

<p>One of their party, another half-breed abandoned many years since
by his father and leading an Indian life, was applied to. He is
reputed a <u>true</u> <u>man</u>: [he] never lies. Out of respect to
the other, he was induced to consent, but much against his will. "For
I am much afraid that [one] of these times <u>they</u> <u>will</u>
<u>carry</u> <u>me</u> <u>off</u>."</p>

<p>He was prepared, and entered with his <u>rattler</u>, shortly after
which the box and the rattler began to move in the usual brisk
and violent manner. <u>Many</u> [spirits] entered, and one asked what
was wanted that they had been called upon. </p>

<p>The Indian, from the outside of the frame (for only the conjurer
alone enters), inquired if there was not some evil spirit near from
whom he had everything to dread.</p>

<p>"No." replied the same voice. "<u>All is quiet</u>, you trouble
yourself with vain phantoms." </p>

<p>"What then is the meaning," asked again the Indian, "of those
sudden flashes of light I sometimes see in the night?"</p>

<p>"What?" rejoined another voice from within. "Hast thou attained
unto this age and never yet observed this?" And then laughing, [it]
continued, "It is always the case during this <u>moon</u>
(December). And if you doubt me, for the future observe attentively
and you will find it to be the case."</p>

<p>This satisfied him for the time. He became cheerful and assumed his
wonted ways, but not for a long time. He soon relapsed and, after some
days, applied again to the conjurer. When he had entered his box or
frame, a number again entered and one of them enquired why they were
called for.</p>

<p>The conjurer said [why].</p>

<p>"What?" says he, the Spirit, "Again! Thou art very skeptical. Dost
thou not believe? Now thou art fond of, thou wantest to be haunted. Well
thou shalt have thy desire!"</p>

<p>At<A NAME = "p2"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="2"></SPAN>
these dreadful words, which were uttered in an angry and reproving
manner, every soul was struck with terror. But as if to give some
consolation, [the voice] assured him that that spirit had but just
left his <u>home</u>, and coming on very slowly, would not be up with
them 'till <u>such a time</u>, a little prior to which they were
ordered to conjure again, when they would be told what to do.</p>

<p>This was no pleasant information to the conjurer who never
undertook this job but with the greatest reluctance&mdash;nay indeed
even sometimes horror. However, he neither, poor creature, had [an]
alternative. At the time appointed he entered again, everything being
prepared. </p>

<p>After the preliminary demands or questions, "Yes," replies one of
the <u>spirits</u>, "that which thou dreadest <u>is</u> near, and is
drawing on apace."</p>

<p>"How shall we do? What shall we do?"  exclaimed the Indian.</p>

<p>At last one of them, who goes by the name of the Bull or Buffaloe,
(through the conjurer, for he alone could understand him, his voice
being hoarse through, his uttering thick and inarticulate) asked the
Indian if he remembered of a dream he made while yet a young man?</p>

<p>"Yes," replies the Indian, "I remember perfectly. I dreamed I saw
one just like yourself who told me that, when advanced in life, I
should be much troubled one winter. But by a certain sacrifice and a
sweating <u><i><b>bout</b></i></u> I should be relieved. But I have
not the means here. I have no stones."</p>

<p>"You are encamped upon them," rejoined the <u>spirit</u>, "and at
the door of your tent are some."</p>

<p>"Yes, but," says the Indian, "the dogs have <u>watered</u> them, &amp;
they are otherwise soiled."</p>

<p>"Fool! Put them in the fire. Will not the fire heat and make them
change color and purify them? Do this, fail not and be not uneasy. We
shall go, four of us (spirits), and amuse him upon the road and
endeavour to drive him back." </p>

<p>At this the interpreter burst out laughing, exclaimed,
"Sacré bande de bêtes! And do you believe all that d&mdash;&mdash;d
nonsense?" </p>

<p>"You doubt too." says a voice addressing him (the interpreter) from
the inside. "Go out of the tent and listen, you'll see if <u>we</u>
lie."</p>

<p>He did indeed go out to some distance, and after a while heard [the
spirits] as a distant hollow noise which increased 'till it became
considerably more distinct, and then vanished as a great gust of wind,
though the night was mild, calm, clear and beautifully serene. It even
startled the dogs.</p>

<p>"<u>Mahn</u>!" (an Indian term or exclamation signifying haste)
said the spirits from within.</p>

<p class="quote"><u>They</u> have turned him off the road as soon as
the noise was heard. But he will not turn back or go home. He
is <u>sent</u> after you by another Indian who conjured him up out of
the deep (the bottom of some flood).  But be not too uneasy. If these
four will not do, there are yet a vast many of us, so that between us
all, we <u>shall</u> drive him back. We will perplex and bewilder him,
surround, torment and tease him on every side. But he is of a
monstrous size, ferocious and withal enraged against you. The task is
mighty difficult. <u>Observe</u>! See how beautifully serene the night
is. If we succeed, the sky will change all of a sudden, and there will
fall a very smart shower of snow attended with a terrible gust of
wind.

<A NAME = "p3"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="3"></SPAN>
This will happen between daylight and sunrise <u>and</u> <u>is</u>
<u>his</u> <u>spirit</u>, all that will remain in his power. He'll
then return to his home.</p>

<p>The interpreter, though he laughed at all this and could not bring
himself to credit it, yet swears that he heard the rumbling
noise <u>on</u> <u>their</u> <u>road</u> and seemingly far off.
The Indians gave implicit faith to all. And the conjurer did not know
what to believe.</p>

<p>"There is something," says he, "for my <u>Dreamed</u>,
or <u>Dreamers</u> have assured me of it, but <u><b>I</b></u> don't
know what to say. However, most assuredly, tomorrow morning we shall
have the snow."</p>

<p>This <u>snow</u> both comforted and depressed the poor Indian very
much seeing the weather was then so beautiful and so destitute of all
the usual signs of bad weather. It did snow. It came as foretold,
quite suddenly, and as suddenly became fine again.</p>

<p>In the ensuing morning, the Indian begged of the interpreter to
chuse one of the longest and straightest pine (epinette) trees he
could find of the thickness of his thigh, to peel off all the bark
nicely, leaving but a small tuft of the branches at the tip end.  This
they painted cross-ways with bars of vermillion and charcoal
alternately the whole length, leaving however some intervals
undaubded. And about five or six feet from the ground, [they] fastened
a pair of artificial horns representing those of a bull, and decorated
[it] with ribbon. He also (the Indian I mean) made the sweating hut,
and in short done [sic] everything as directed, after which he (the
Indian) became to resume his wonted cheerfulness and contentment.</p>

<p>However, once more he was obliged to have recourse again to the
conjurer, from hearing another rumbling noise. "Thou Fool!" answered
the spirits. "Wilt thou never have done tormenting thyself and
disquieting us. That rumbling noise proceeds from the ice on a lake a
long way off. It is only the ice. Be therefore peaceable. I shall
[advise] thee if any ill is to happen thee."</p>

<p>The flashes of light, or those sudden glares that the Indian
inquired of the spirits, is, as they told him, lightening which always
happens in the month of December. And they laughed at his having lived
so long without observing it before.</p>

<p>The conjurer had lost his smoking bag one day that he was out a
hunting. And as it contained his only steel and not a small part of
his winter stock of tobacco, he was very uneasy and hunted several
times for it. They, having told the Interpreter often how kind and
charitable and indulgent those <u>spirits of the upper regions</u>
were, and he, desirous of proving them, told the conjurer to send for
his bag. He asked, "Which of ye will go for my bag that I lost? He
that brings it me, I shall make him smoke."</p>

<p>"I will go," said one. They heard a fluttering noise, and soon
after they heard the same fluttering noise, and the rattler move, and
down fell the bag by the conjurer, covered with snow.</p>

<p>"How stupid thou art!" said the spirit naming the conjurer. "Thou
passedst over it and yet did not see it." It was a long time since the
bag was lost, and the distance was several miles.</p>

<p>Another one could not kill with his gun, owing to its being crooked
or some other cause.

<A NAME = "p4"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="4"></SPAN>
However, he attached the fault to the gun. [This happened] the first
time, I believe it was, that this half-breed conjured. The people on
the outside, hearing many voices speak as they entered, at last they
stopped at one whose voice and articulation was different from that of
the others. "Who is that one just now entered?" said those
outside.</p>

<p>"It is the <u>Sun</u>," replied the conjurer.</p>

<p>"Ha! Well, I am happy of it." said the the Indian. "Is it
not <u>he</u> who says himself able to repair firearms (guns), and do
anything with them he pleases? Ask him (addressing the conjurer) if he
will not have compassion on me and put my gun to rights that I also
may kill. I am walking every day, and frequently shoot at moose, but
always miss."</p>

<p>"Hand it me." said a voice from the top of the conjuring frame. The
gun was given to the conjurer. "It is loaded." continued the voice,
"Shall I fire it off?"</p>

<p>"You may, but take care you hurt nobody." replied the Indian. The
gun was fired, and shortly after handed back to the owner.</p>

<p> "Here is your gun. You will kill with it now." said the
Spirit.</p>

<p>Both this business of the gun and smoking bag took place the first
time, I believe, the man conjured.</p>

<h4 class="section"><a name = "s3" href= "#tocs3">[Initiations and Conjuring]</a></h4>
<p>There are but few individuals (men) among the Sauteux or Cris
or Crees who have not their medicine bags and [are not] initiated into
some ceremony or other. But it is not <u>all</u> of them who can
conjure. Among some tribes most of them can, and among others again
there are but very few.  Nor is it every one of them that tells <u>all
truth</u>, some scarcely nothing but lies, others again <b>Not One</b>
falsehood. And this depends upon their <u>Dreamed</u>, sometimes.  But
I think [it] may be equally imputed to their own selves, [to]
presumption, ignorance, folly, or any other of our passions or
weaknesses. </p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s3.1" href = "#tocs3.1">[In Quest of Dreams]</a></h5>
<p>But to become conjurers, they have rites and ceremonies to
perform and go through, which, though apparently simple and absurd,
yet I have no doubt, but fully answer their ends.</p>

<p>Any person among them wishing to dive into futurity must be young
and unpolluted, at any age between 18 and 25, though as near as I can
learn between 17 and 20 years old. They must have had no intercourse
with the other sex; they must be chaste and unpolluted.</p>

<p>In the spring of the year, they chuse a proper place at a
sufficient distance from the camp not [to] be discovered nor
disturbed. They make themselves a bed of grass, or hay as we term it,
and have besides enough to make them a covering. When all this is
done, and they do it entirely alone, they strip stark naked and put
all their things <u><b>a good way off</b></u>. And then [they] return,
lie on this bed, and then cover themselves with the rest of the grass.
Here they remain and endeavour to <u>sleep</u>, which from their
nature is no very difficult task.  But during whatever time they may
remain, they must neither eat nor drink. If they want to dream of the
spirits above, their bed must be made at some distance from the
ground&mdash;if of the spirits inhabiting our Earth, or those residing
in the waters,

<A NAME = "p5"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="5"></SPAN>
on the ground. Here they lie for a longer or shorter time according
to their success or the orders of the dreamed. Some remain but three
or four days, some ten. And I have [been] told one remained thirty days
without eating or drinking. Such was the delight he received from his
dreams!</p>

<p>When I laughed at this, the man was vexed, the others not a little
hurt.</p>

<p>The first thing they do after their return to their friends is to
take a good drink of water, smoke the pipe, and after that eat, but as
composedly as but just risen from a hearty meal. Their <u>Dreamed</u>
sometimes order them to make a feast, and not uncommonly tell them
where to go where they will find the animals whose flesh is to be
served up (always boiled). They sometimes lie in one posture and
sometimes another&mdash;i.e. their head to some one of the cardinal
points. Some have the most pleasant dreams imaginable, others
indifferent.</p>

<p>When they are to live to a good old age, they are told, "You will
see many winters! Your head will grow quite white."  or "Though you
shall never see your head white, yet you shall live till you are
obliged to make use of a stick and long after. You shall die old, very
old, respected and regretted."</p>

<p>If they are to die young: "Thou shalt see the years of a young
man."&mdash;and so on of the other ages, as well as the manner of life
they shall have. The language is not very dissimilar to that of our
version of the Bible. But that stile seems to me to be the language of
nature which <u>I</u> always find the more charming the more retired
the <u>speaker</u> is from the pompous bombastic walks of <u>high</u>
life, which though they furnish us with more ideas, <u>I</u> do not
think add much to the beauty of the language.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s3.2" href= "#tocs3.2">[Dialogue with a Spirit]</a></h5>
<p>As I have said before, the purpose of these dreams is to dive into
futurity. Everything in nature appears unto them, but in the shape of
a human being. They dream they meet a man who asks them (after some
preliminary conversation of course), "Dost thou know me?" (who or what
I am?).</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Follow me then!" replies this stranger. The Indian follows. The
other leads him to his abode and again makes the inquiry. The answer
is perhaps as before. Then the stranger assumes his proper form, which
is perhaps that of a tree, a stone, a fish. And after rechanging
several times in this manner, until such time as the Indian becomes
perfectly to know him, then this stranger gives him to smoke,
[teaches] him <u>his</u> song, thus addressing him, "Now do you
remember my song? Whenever you will wish to call upon me, sing this
song, and I shall not be far. I will come and do for you what you
require."</p>

<h4 class="section"><a name = "s3.3" href= "#tocs3.3">[Principal Spirits]</a></h4>
<p>They know many of <u>these</u> <u>Spirits</u> as soon as they see
them (in their dreams) by the description the other Indians have given
of them. Some, however, they know from their nature. When
the <u>Snow</u> addresses them, he they know because he is perfectly
white&mdash;the <u>Ice</u> also. The Sun and Moon [they know]
from their beautiful brilliancy and the elegance of their
abode&mdash;the houses of the two last being uncommonly neat and
handsome such as those of

<A NAME = "p6"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="6"></SPAN>
the white (i.e. civilized).</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s3.3.1" href= "#tocs3.3.1">[Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k / Gey-Shay-mani-<u>to</u>]</a></h5>
<p>One principal amongst all these, and everything in nature appears
at least to some of them, is the Supreme Being, whom they term
Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k (the last a's being pronounced as in
'all', 'hawk' etc.; the first as ale, bail etc.) i.e. by his proper
name, his common name, Gey-Shay-mani-<u>to</u> (this is among the
Crees nation), which signifies "the Greatly charitable Spirit."  He is
uncommonly good and kind, addresses them and talks to them as to
children whom he most tenderly loves and is extremely anxious for.</p>


<p>Thus far everything is very well, and is perhaps a
better <u>idea</u> than many of the vulgar christians can give. But on
the other hand again, their mythology, or stories relating to him, are
many of them absurd and indecent in the highest degree, reducing him
to the level of his creatures, and not unfrequently their making him
dupe, but become so by such vile, such abominable deception as I doubt
to be equalled by the most absurd and romantic of the Arabian
tales. For there are many of these tales the author durst not publish
for the obscenity and indecency. There are some obscene passages also
in these tales (of the Indians) but not more than might be expected
from a people yet in a perfect state of nature as to their mental
powers, to our eternal shame and scandal. This one they love, they
love him a great deal, and are by no means afraid of him, because he
always addresses them "my little children" and all the rest of his
character is of a piece with this.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s3.3.2" href= "#tocs3.3.2">[Key-jick-oh-kay (Old Nick)]</a></h5>
<p>The next one is Old Nick. Him some term "Key-jick-oh-kay" (The 'J'
being pronounced soft, as Git or Gil, in French, for I know of no
English word where properly speaking the J is of any use and has the
sound seemed intended by it) or "Key-jick-oh-ka<u>iw</u>". I cannot at
present give the proper signification of this name for I am not
sufficiently acquainted with the language, but it appears to me as to
mean "he who made the day or skies, or resides in the sky". This one
they represent wicked, and terrible, inexorable to the highest degree,
always plotting evil and endeavouring to circumvent the rest of the
creation. [He] is always jawing and bawling. But when the other
appears, he orders him in a peremptory manner. "Hold thy tongue. Get
thee hence, thou deceiver; thou ill-liver." But these words are
uttered in such an authoratative and commanding tone that the Indians
themselves are quite astonished to see one who is so uncommonly kind
and indulgent to them in every respect, so tender and affectionate,
even in the choice of his words, assume so suddenly and with so much
authority, so much power over one whose name alone they never utter
but with the greatest dread and horror. Their horror of the Devil is
so great, that no one ever utters [his name] but when unavoidable. And if,
through inadvertency or ignorance, one of their children should
mention it, he is severely reprimanded by all who hear.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s3.3.3" href= "#tocs3.3.3">[Water Lynx]</a></h5>
<p>There is also the Sea Serpent, a monstrous animal and has much
power.

<A NAME = "p7"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="7"></SPAN>
The Mermaid (or Sea-Man), the Water Lynx or rather Tyger&mdash;a
dreadful character [is] this last, who keeps all the inhabitants of
the deep in the greatest subjection. There are however one or two who
contend with him, and sometimes he is reduced to the necessity of
compounding with them&mdash;the Great Turtle, and many others. They have
their abodes in the deep, but perfectly dry and comfortable. Each one
of these, and indeed all of them, have their stories or
mythology. Some I forget entirely and others remember too incorrectly
to mention at present.</p>

<p>{These [spirits], when anyone conjures, if he is a renowned <u>medicine</u>
man, <u>they</u> all appear and speak to him mostly in his own
language. Some few excepted are the <u>Pike</u> (a jack fish) who
speaks French, the Sun and Moon both speak English, the Bull or
Buffaloe in an unknown, or at least strange, language. But all [are]
perfectly intelligible to the conjurer.</p>

<p>I am quite astray&mdash;leaving the proper thread of my story to
follow one of its branches. I ought to have said that.}</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s3.3.4" href= "#tocs3.3.4">[Sun]</a></h5>
<p>The Sun, when he appears to an Indian, he is seen in the heavens,
as an Indian (i. e. a man) <i><u>walking on the wind</u></i>. His dress
is of a variety of colors and handsome.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s3.3.4.1" href= "#tocs3.3.4.1">[A Dream Meeting with Sun]</a></h5>
<p>I had a dream the latter part of which I shall relate to you as it
is perfectly descriptive of the manner or form in which the Sun
appears.  I related it the next day to some of my half-breeds, when
one of them replied, "What a pity! Had you now forborne for a few days
mentioning <u>this</u>, he would have appeared again to you, and then
you would have had a fine opportunity of learning (from the
fountain-head, as we might say) how it is the Indians come to perform
those things the white will never credit." And he continued that it
was precisely the form he assumed when he appears to the Indians.</p>

<p>In my dream I thought we were travelling a road from which some of
our party had the utmost to dread from the ambush of an Indian who
could transport himself to what place he pleased. As we were walking, I
happened to look above and was much struck with the appearance of a
man walking in the heavens. His dress was that of a
neat <u>Southern</u> Indian, composed mostly of red and yellow, but
also of a few other colors. The garters of his leggings were also neat
and handsome and had a tuft of swans-down that had been powdered with
vermillion attached to the knot on the back part of the leg. To his
shoes were attached two long swan quills inclosing the foot thus
<img src="images/diag1.png" alt="diagram of Sun's footwear"> with a
tuft of down at each end and in the middle on both sides all powdered
with vermillion. With these quills and down, and the down on his
garters, [he was buoyed] up in the air. I addressed [him] in broken Cree. He
answered in the same broken accent. Upon my second address, I thought
he did not understand more of that language than I did myself. The
Sauteux seemed to me his proper tongue, and I was glad of having an
opportunity of speaking that language. So I the third time addressed
him in it, asked him from whence he came, whither he was going. He was
very

<A NAME = "p8"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="8"></SPAN>
high, insomuch that the others thought it preposterous in my
addressing him&mdash;that he could not hear from that distance. Upon
this he came down and talked with us, saying he was
an <u>ambassador</u>. Such is the habillement, and manner in which the
Sun shews himself.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s3.3.5" href= "#tocs3.3.5">[Thunder]</a></h5>
<p>The Thunder also appears to them, in the shape and form of a most
beautiful bird (The Pea-Cock).</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s3.4" href= "#tocs3.4">[Roots and Herbs (Medicines)]</a></h5>
<p>Roots and herbs also (this also ought to have come in afterwards),
such as are medicinal, appear, and teach their votaries their
respective songs, how they must do, what ceremonies they must perform
in taking them out of the ground, their different applications. But
these roots [and] herbs (medicines), though they appear in their
dreams, they do not shew themselves in the conjuring hut, box, or
frame, that I learn. They are sent, as appears, by
Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k, <i>to teach Indians their use and virtue</i> without
which <i>they would be very ill off, whether to heal or cure themselves,
or expell the charms by which other Indians may have bewitched them.</i>
And though they are acquainted with many of these roots, the use and
virtue of some of which I can no more doubt than those used by the
faculty in the civilized world, yet they tell me there are several
which they use to different, and some to diametrically opposite,
purposes.</p>

<h4 class="section"><a name = "s4" href= "#tocs4">[The Manner of Conjuring]</a></h4>
<h5 class="section"><a name = "s4.1" href= "#tocs4.1">[Building the Lodge]</a></h5>
<p>Their manner of conjuring is this: In the first place a number [of]
straight poles of two, or two and a half inches diameter and about
eight or nine feet long are prepared, cut, branched and pointed at the
lower end. They seldom require so <u>few</u> as four, commonly six or
eight. These are planted in the ground from twelve to twenty or
twenty-four inches deep in an hexagon or octagon form, enclosing a
space of three feet diameter, more or less. These poles are secured by
hoops, three or four in number, and well tied to each pole, so that
none be able to move without the rest. This hut, square, box, or
frame, whatever it may be termed, is covered with skins, an oil cloth,
or some such sort of thing.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s4.2" href= "#tocs4.2">[Preparing the Conjurer]</a></h5>
<p>The conjurer is bound hand and foot, not as if he were a man going
to <u>pry</u> into futurity, but as a criminal, [a] <u>mere</u>, pure
devil, and one whom they intend never to loosen, so barricaded and
cross-corded is the creature, sometimes all crumpled into a heap. He
is tied only with his cloute on him, and thus thrust into the hut
underneath by raising the lower covering, his "she-she-quay" or
rattler with him.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s4.3" href= "#tocs4.3">[Spirits who Enter the Lodge and Interactions with
Them]</a></h5>
<p>Some of them sing on entering, others make a speech. Here they
remain, some several hours, others not five minutes, before fluttering
is heard. The rattler is shaked at a merry rate, and all of a sudden,
either from the top, or below, away flies the cords by which the
Indian was tied, <u>into the lap of he who tied him</u>. It is then
that the Devil is at work. Every instant some one or other enters,
which is known to those outside by either the fluttering, the rubbing
against the skins of the hut in descending (inside) or the shaking of
the rattler, and sometimes all together. When any enter, the hut moves
in a most violent manner. I have frequently thought that it would be
knocked down, or torn out of the ground.</p>

<A NAME = "p9"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="9"></SPAN>
<h5 class="section"><a name = "s4.3.1" href= "#tocs4.3.1">[Meeh-key-nock (Turtle)]</a></h5>
<p>The first who enters is commonly Meeh-key-nock (the Turtle), a
jolly, jovial sort of a fellow who, after disencumbering his votary,
chats and jokes with those outside and asks for a pipe to smoke. There
is a good deal of talking inside as may be supposed from the number of
folks collected in so small a space.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s4.3.2" href= "#tocs4.3.2">[Thunder]</a></h5>
<p>To some renowned characters, all the spirits appear. The Thunder
also frequently comes, but he is desired to remain outside as he would
breake all. It is reported that he once entered and split one of the
poles into shivers.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s4.3.3" href= "#tocs4.3.3">[Flying Squirrel]</a></h5>
<p>The Flying Squirrel also enters. He is no liar, but you must take
every thing he says as we do our dreams, the opposite. His nature is
such that he durst not tell the truth but in this ambiguous manner,
otherwise the conjurer would soon after die.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s4.3.4" href= "#tocs4.3.4">[Wolverine]</a></h5>
<p>I do not know that the Skunk ever comes. But the Wolverine
(Carcajoux) does and he is known immediately by his stink, which
occasions no small merriment at his expense on the outside. </p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s4.3.5" href= "#tocs4.3.5">[Loon]</a></h5>
<p>The <u>Loon</u> also enters. He is known by his usual cry, "Nee-wih
wee-way" repeated commonly three times as he does when in the
water. And this too occasions a great laugh, for these four syllables,
which form the most common cry of that bird in the <u>spring</u> of
the year, as every body may observe, <u>are</u> also three words in
the Sauteux and Cree languages, which signify "I want to marry; I want
to marry!" </p>

<p>"What! And will you never have done marrying? You were marrying all
last summer and still want to!" will some outside say. And everyone
has his word to put in.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s4.3.6" href= "#tocs4.3.6">[Hercules / Strong Neck: Altercation with a Young Man]</a></h5>
<p><u>Hercules</u> also comes in. He is perhaps as much revered by
those people as even he was by the Spartan or Athenians. His name
is <b>Strong Neck</b> (and everybody knows how strong Hercules was). He
does not seem over fond of jokes, and when the other spirits announce
his coming, all those on the outside must cover their heads and not
look up, for it appears that he cannot [become] <u>invisible</u> as the
others do, or will not, but still does not chuse to be seen.</p>

<p class="quote">Once upon a time his arrival was announced, and
everybody was ordered to cover themselves, so as not to see. (This,
and all such like orders are commands sent to the conjurer, and which
he, (being inside) must <u>promulgate</u> to those on the
outside). There was one young buck, however, who wanted to shew
himself superior to these orders and divert his friends. [He] would
not cover himself. Hercules entered, and at that time, as at all
others, he was not in too good a humor. Some altercation ensued and "I
am Strong Neck." said he. </p>

<p class="quote">"Pah!" says the young man at last, "The neck of my
os-Pubis indeed is [as] strong!" This raised a most violent laugh. But
the young man was lost. He disappeared from amongst them, and was
never after heard of. Since <u>that</u> time they are rather more
cautious.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s4.3.7" href= "#tocs4.3.7">[O-may-me-thay-day-ce-cee-wuck (Ancients or
Hairy Breasts)]</a></h5>
<p> Some of the <u>Ancients</u> also enter. They are called
"O-may-me-thay-day-ce-cee-wuck", <u>Hairy</u> <u>Breasts</u>

<A NAME = "p10"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="10"></SPAN>
such as the ancients are said to be. These are great boasters. They
recount the exploits of their younger days apparently with the
greatest satisfaction. [They] say, "I used to do so and so on such
occasions. I never shot a moose or buffaloe, but pursued them on my
feet, and ripped them open with my knife."  But this is
only <u>wind</u>, for no sooner do other powerful ones enter, but
these chaps search to secret themselves.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s4.3.8" href= "#tocs4.3.8">[Sun]</a></h5>
<p>The Sun enters, speaks very bad English at the offset, but by
degrees becomes to speak it very easily and fluently. He is gun smith
and watch-maker, or at least can repair them. When he is entered,
there is commonly a beautiful clear light visible, through the
covering. He [too] does not admit of too much familiarity, but is
still good natured and condescending.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s4.3.9" href= "#tocs4.3.9">[Pike]</a></h5>
<p>The Pike or Jack fish also enters. As the Sun, [he] also speaks
(French,) badly enough at the offset. </p>

<p class="quote"> When there are two or three on the outside who can
speak French and address him together, merely to perplex and bother
him, he laughs at their folly and says, "You may talk twenty or a
hundred of you together if you chuse, yet are you not able to perplex
me. Come as numerously as you chuse, yet are there many more of
us <u>Pike</u> than you Frenchmen." </p>

<p>He is very familiar too.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s4.3.10" href= "#tocs4.3.10">[Buffaloe]</a></h5>
<p>The Bull, or Buffaloe is understood only by the conjurer, his voice
being hoarse, and rough, his language quite foreign. The conjurer must
interpret when anything is wanted of him. As is his voice, so are his
manners. However, he will joke a little too. But let them beware not
to let drop anything in a sarcastic or contemptuous manner as to his
power or knowledge of the future for he takes it up and reproves in
a very tart manner. And [he does this] in a way too that conveys no
comfortable ideas to anyone present, for they all endeavour to excuse
it by saying it is only a joke. "I know jokes too; and I can laugh and
understand the nature of laughing as well as the best amongst
you. But such language is unbecoming, and I will have no more of
it!"</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s4.3.11" href= "#tocs4.3.11">[Omniscience of Spirits]</a></h5>
<p class="quote">A half breed one time, <u>because</u> <u>his</u> <u>father</u>
<u>was</u> <u>a</u> <u>Frenchman</u>, thought he might go any lengths
he pleased with him (the B[uffaloe]). He replied very warmly thus:</p>

<p class="quote"> "How durst thou doubt anything I say! Knowest thou
not how clearly and distinctly objects are discovered and seen in a
plain from an eminence? And my abode is in the regions above. I see
every object as distinctly as you see at your feet. Doubt then no

<p class="quote">"Aye!" replied some of the other spirits, "We not
only see <u>all</u> <u>that</u> <u>you</u> <u>do</u>, <u>however</u>
<u>secret</u> <u>and
hid</u> <u>you</u> <u>think</u> <u>yourselves</u>, but we also hear
every word you utter." </p>

<p class="quote">"If that indeed be the case, tell me where now are
and when will be here my father's countrymen?" {The conjurer had been
employed to tell what the people were about, as it was long since the
time they were expected, and ought to have arrived, had elapsed.} </p>

<p class="quote">"Wait! I shall go and see." And shortly after he
returned.  "They are now all asleep at such a place. The weather will
be calm tomorrow, and though the

<A NAME = "p11"></A>

as anxious as yourselves."</p>

<p class="quote"> Another one said, "Since then ye Spirits pretend to
know everything and are vexed when we call any of your sayings in
question, come tell me how long shall I live?  Shall I yet see two
more winters?"</p>

<p class="quote">"Ha!" (laughing replied the same voice) "Two winters?
I see you all yet alive two winters hence. Every soul that sits here
and considerably more; and some of you I see crawling with old
age!"</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s4.3.12" href= "#tocs4.3.12">[Showing the Turtle Spirit]</a></h5>
<p>With some of the Spirits, as I've already said, the bystanders (or
setters, for they are seated on the ground round about) are very
familiar. The Turtle is one of them. He is very humorsome, and their
jokes with him were such (for I've heard this myself) as I should have
been ashamed to hold even with a bawd. It was pure <u>ribaldry</u>.
But they durst not doubt him when he speaks seriously, for he is very
powerful, and makes himself respected when he thinks it
necessary. </p>

<p>"Who is that now speaking?" said one of the Indians. (This I was
told.)</p>

<p>"It is Mihkenach," said the conjurer.</p>

<p>"If it be him, prove it. Take him in your hand and show him to us."
Now the conjurer was a very great medicine man. He took the turtle upon
his hand, raised the covering of his <u>box</u>, and called them to
look. Every one was astonished at his beauty. He was very small,
scarcely more than two inches long. When all had gazed enough, the
conjurer drew him in.</p>

<p>The Turtle was very quiet while out, but as soon as he got in
exclaimed, "Oh! how afraid I was when I saw the children look so
eagerly. I was afraid some of them would have attempted to take me in
their hands and let me fall, perhaps in the fire." and laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>Towards the latter end, Master Keyjickahkaiw, that old serpent
Satan, enters. His arrival is announced. All hands are grieved for
then the conclusion is soon to take place. He makes everything fly
again, kicking up his own (the Devil's) racket, jawing and blabbing,
scolding and giving the lie to and abusing all hands.  The Indians are
hurt and displeased, but durst not say anything. They must swallow all
quietly And then it is that the conjurer most dreads for his
own <u>bacon</u>. This however does not last very long, for
Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k (the Supreme Being) enters last. As soon as his coming
is announced, Nick begins to sneak, but still <u>en

<p>The Indians are uncommonly fond of Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k. He commonly

because he is wickedly inclined. Mischief and destruction are in his

for he is ever on the watch to destroy you.</p>

<p>When <u>Charly</u> enters, after some abuse, he calls out, "Get ye
hence, get ye hence. What are ye doing so long from your home? Off
with ye immediately!". And [he] rubs up and down the skins that form
the covering lest any should be hid. Thus he sends off all the
spirits, who, as they <u>fly</u> off, as well as when they enter, give
this frame a terrible shaking. It may be supposed what sort of a
shaking he gives as he comes and goes, and how he shakes the
rattler;&mdash;for they all shake the rattler on entering. When
Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k goes off all is done.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s4.4" href= "#tocs4.4">[Practices of Powerful Conjurers]</a></h5>
<p>Some conjurers are so powerful that the <u>hut</u> they enter, must
be doubled; that is two rows or sets of poles, one on the outside [of]
the other, and each row fastened with good strong hoops well tied,
after which the outer and inner row are also fastened. Thus arranged
they seem to be beyond the power of any three or four men to move. Yet
when the spirits enter, it sets a-going with a motion equal to that of
a single pole indifferently stuck in the ground and violently moved by
a man. </p>

<p>I have never seen any of these double ones, but twice or thrice saw
the others whilst the conjurer was in. Some time afterwards, when they
were off, I shook them with both hands and with all my strength, but
the motion was nothing like that of the conjurers. I have been told
that those [conjurers] who enter these double ones are so powerful
that almost all the creation comes to see them, and [the poles] are shaken
with uncommon violence. </p>

<p>This motion, the conjurers say, is produced by the concussion of
the air. The spirits come and enter with such velocity that it is
the <u>wind</u> <u>they</u> <u>produce</u> which occasions it.  The
conjurer is all the while seated peaceably in the bottom, (on the
ground) of his hut.</p>

<p>Some of them to shew their power have had small sticks of the
hardest wood (such as produces the wild pear, and of which the Indians
make their arrows, and ram-rods for guns) about the size of a man's
finger, made as sharp-pointed as possible and dried, when they become
in consequence nearly as dangerous as iron or bayonets. Some have
eighteen, twenty-four, more or less, though seldom less than eighteen
planted in the bottom of their hut. They are about twelve or fourteen
inches out of the ground.</p>

<p>On the points of these sticks is the conjurer placed, sometimes on
his bottom, at others on his knees and elbows. And there he remains as
quietly and composedly as if he were on <i>"<u>a bed of
roses</u>"</i>.  And when he comes off, no marks of injury appear,
though he entered naked, only his cloute about him, and of course the
cords with which he is tied. <i>Their familiars (their dreamed, or
those who appear to them in their dreams and promise them their
assistance and protection) support them so that no injury happens
them!!!</i></p>

Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k &amp; Mishabose)]</a></h5>
<p>March 29th.&mdash;I feel but very indifferently disposed to write,
but I am on the eve of an accumulation of business and may not after
a few days have the necessary time, so that I shall [take the] risk.</p>

<p> A couple of days back, I have been conversing with a Cree (Indian)
who <u>piecemeal</u> gives me the following account of their
mythology:</p>

<p>The North (Wind), apparently one of oldest of created rational
beings, thus addressed his daughter, his only child, "My daughter! Be
very careful, and remember that anything you do, or wherever you go,
on turning yourself,
turn <u>always</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u>
<u>direction</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>sun</u>, <u>and</u>
<u>never</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>contrary</u> <u>direction</u>."</p>

<p>Now women are a compound of perverseness, obstinacy and curiosity,
and withall forgetful enough too <u>sometimes</u>. This girl, one day
she was chopping fire-wood. Without thinking of her father's
admonition, in going to another tree, [she] turned round to the right
in a contrary direction to the sun, and instantly fell to the ground
and died.</p>

<p>The time she used to take up in this occupation being expired, her
parents became very uneasy, and after some search, found her on
her <u>back</u> dead, and her belly [swollen] to an enormous size. The
father and mother, on each or opposite sides, contemplated her
situation with great grief. At last the father arose, stood up, and
made a long speech, praying to "The Father of Life" to have mercy and
compassion on his child.</p>

<p>His speech was not ineffectual. The girl was delivered of a boy,
and shortly after, of another. The elder was called Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k; the
younger "Mi (or Mee) shaw-bôse". After this the girl recovered
and became as aforetime. These two young men immediately attained
"man's estate", manhood, and became hunters.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s5.2" href= "#tocs5.2">[Death of Mishabôse]</a></h5>
<p>The younger of the two one day was in pursuit of a grey or rein
deer (carriboeuf), after which also pursued a wolf. The deer, having
thus no hopes of escape, fled to a rock on the edge of the waters and
plunged in. Mishabôse and the wolf followed. But they all three became
a prey to the Michi-Pichoux, or Great Lynx, i.e. Water Lynx,
Water-Cat, or Water Dog.</p>

<p>After some further conversation,  Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k discovered the means of
avenging himself. He accordingly set to work and made himself
a <u>large</u> <u>canoe</u> on board of which he embarked the Moose,
Deer, Bear, Otter, Beaver, Muskrat, Wolf [and others] and
repaired to the place where the Sea Lynxes used to resort to sleep.
This was a fine, pleasant place on the land. Here he observed several
of them and began his work. It is not related how many he did kill,
but the water upon their death came rushing upon him in a violent
torrent.</p>

<p> As he expected this, he had brought his canoe near hand. But
before he reached it, after killing his enemies, he was already
knee-deep

<A NAME = "p14"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="14"></SPAN>
in the water. However, he got safely on board, but in his hurry [he]
forgot to embark a little earth.</p>

<p> Now the waters swelled immensely, and in a very short time the
highest land was covered, and Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k was tossed about by the
wind and water. It appears that he had not the foresight either of
taking with him sufficiency of provisions, for he became very hungry,
and thus expressed himself to his crew.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s5.4.2" href= "#tocs5.4.2">[Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k Tricks a Water Lynx and Beaver]</a></h5>
<p> After some time he saw something on the water, very large and
moving toward him. He thus addressed it, "Who or what art thou my
younger brother?" (For he, being the first born, always addressed the
rest of the creation, whether animate, inanimate, or rational or not,
as his <u>younger</u> <u>brothers</u>.) "And whither art thou going?"
</p>

<p>"Why, my elder (brother), I am a <u>Water</u> <u>Lynx</u>, and am
sent by <u>confrers</u> in search of Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k and to destroy
him! </p>

<p>"Aye! Is it so indeed? And how or with what instrument do you
intend to destroy him?"</p>

<p>"I have a large and very strong iron tail, with
which if I smite his canoe he must perish!"</p>

<p>Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k, seeing his danger, thought to get off by duplicity
and dissimulation, and thus continued, "Indeed you must have a very
extraordinary <u>tail</u>, my <u>younger</u> [brother] ....  Come near
and let me see it, how it is made."</p>

<p>The Lynx drew up, presented his tail. Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k took hold as to
look on it, and placed it on the gunnel of his canoe and with a
stone cut it off saying, "Now go to thy friends, and tell them how
Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k has served thee."</p>

<p>He retired double quick, grieved, ashamed, and not with a
little pain. </p>

<p>"Ha!" said the Water Lynxes on perceiving the situation of their
companion, "Ha! Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k is cunning, and too powerful. We must
destroy him for our own safety. Come now. Who amongst us will
volunteer, and go to destroy that enemy of ours?"</p>

<p>They at last pitched upon an enormous beaver and thus addressed him
at his departure. "Go thou, our brother. Destroy that mutual enemy of
ours. Be not afraid of him for he is not worthy of fear. But still be
cautious, for he is very artful."</p>

<p> Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k descryed him also, and the same addresses and
compliments passed as with the first. "And how do you intend to
destroy Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k?"</p>

<p>"With my teeth."</p>

<p>"Well then do come near and let me see them."</p>

<p>The beaver drew up, and shewed his teeth.  Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k put his
hand on his head and while exclaiming "What terrible teeth! How
immensely broad and sharp! They are like large axes!" He, with his
other hand, took up a large stone and with a dreadful blow broke them
all in his head. "Now go thou too to your friends and tell them how
Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k hath served thee."</p>

<p>Indeed the beaver did go, sniffling and blowing and yelling.  The
Lynxes were astonished and durst no more attempt anything at him.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s5.4.3" href= "#tocs5.4.3">[Recreation of the Land]</a></h5>
<p>His situation, however, was very disagreable, very uncomfortable,
and what added to it was his want of food.  He thus addressed his
companions one day, "Come now, we very reprehensibly forgot to bring
earth with us, and who knows how long this will

<A NAME = "p15"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="15"></SPAN>
continue? Which of you all will endeavour to get a little earth for me
out of which I shall try to make <u>land</u> for us to live on?
Whoever will go shall be amply rewarded."</p>

<p>They all said it was very deep. There was scarcely an hope.</p>

<p>Then he said to the Otter, "Go thou, my <u>Younger</u> (brother), and
if thou diest in the attempt, I shall restore thee to life, and make
thee immortal." Saying this he tied a long leather thong to his tail
and sent him down. He found the otter was dead, hauled him up in to
the canoe, rubbed him dry and blowed in his nostrils, when he
revived.</p>

<p>Then he sent the Musk Rat. "Come, my little brother, go thou, thou
art small and very active, art fond of the water, and goeth to great
depths. Thy reward shall be as that of the Otter." The rat was secured
with a thong also, and down he went. Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k found he was dead,
hauled him up, and was extremely happy to find he had some earth in
his little paws and mouth. He restored him to life as he did the
otter, and sent him down again. When he brought [him] up, his mouth
[was] as full as it could hold, and a good deal [was] in
his <u>hands</u> which he held pressed to [his] breast.</p>

<p>Now Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k took this earth and made a ball of it, and blew
[on] it a considerable time. And [he] sent off the Wolf to make its
circuit to see if it was large enough.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s5.4.4" href= "#tocs5.4.4">[Wolf Surveys the Land]</a></h5>
<p>After four nights he returned and thus spake, "My Elder, the earth
is indeed large and beautiful, but our number now is small. When we
will increase, it will be too small for us. We will be all upon top of
each other." (We will be in each other's way etc.) "And if you make man
as you contemplate, it will be much more so."</p>

<p>Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k then blew it out again and once more sent the
wolf. He was eight nights absent, and reported it still too
small. Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k then blew it out for a long time and sent the
wolf again.</p>

<p>But before he went off he said, "My Elder, the Earth must now be
very large, and I shall possibly be too much wearied to make its
circuit. I shall traverse, and if I find anything to assure me of its
being large enough, I shall <u>howl</u>, which will be a sign to
you. And whatever place may suit me, there will I make my
residence."</p>

<p>After several nights absence they heard him howl, wherefore they
all concluded the Earth was sufficiently large. </p>

<p>Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k then <u>blessed</u> the others and sent them away
telling them to multiply, "and be good, not vicious or ill inclined,
nor secret or hide [yourselves] too much from <u>my</u> little
brothers, (the human beings, which he was about to create) when they
might want to eat."</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s5.5" href= "#tocs5.5">[Creation of Humans]</a></h5>
<p>Now after this he became very lonesome and bethought himself of
making <u>Indians</u>, human beings. He, in consequence, took up a
stone and fashioned it into the form of a man. But whilst at this
work, it struck him that by forming them of so strong and hard a
substance that, in time when they would [come] to know their nature,
they would grow insolent and rebellious, and be a great annoyance to
each other, and of course also would never die. "This will not do.

<A NAME = "p16"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="16"></SPAN>
I must make them of a more weake and fragible substance so that they
may live a reasonable time and behave as becomes human beings."  Upon
this he took up a handful of common earth and made the form of a man,
and blew into his nostrils <u>the breath of life</u>.</p>

<p> The Moon formed the female as Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k did the male, hence
the reason of the periodical return of their sickness with that of the
Moon, "as also among the sluts" (bitches).  Hence also all women are
forbidden, when they go out from the calls of nature, and
that <u>one</u> in particular, to look at the moon while thus
employed. Those who are thus forgetful, ignorant or obstinate
immediately find the effect by the return.
</p>

<p>I should have said that he bruised the stone to pieces, although a
great part of it was already formed.</p>

<p>For the white (I believe it was the Moon again), he made a partner
for him of one of his ribs and another piece, which he wrapped in a
handkerchief and laid beside him saying, "This, by the time thou
risest, shall be a full grown woman and shall be thy companion."</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s5.6" href= "#tocs5.6">[Separation of Land into Plains and Woods]</a></h5>
<p>After all this done, he made a separation in the Earth, one part of
which was a beautiful, plain meadow ground, and the rest woody.

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s5.7" href= "#tocs5.7">[Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k Travels the Earth, Has a Son,
Becomes a Woman]</a></h5>
<p>And then [he] set off travelling in the Earth. He took a partner to
himself by whom he had a son. This soon got to man's estate, but had a
great aversion to the female sex, which gave his parents a great deal
of anxiety. All their trouble, all their remonstrances, were to no
effect. At last the father bethought of a plan in which he was sure of
success.</p>

<p>[He] transformed himself into a most beautiful woman.
And when the son was returned from his hunting, "Well son!" said the
mother, "Here is a young and handsome woman we have procured merrily
for thee. Does she please thee?"</p>

<p>Her <u>charms</u> were so great the young man immediately became
extremely fond of her. But this, in the end, became the source of much
trouble to both parents&mdash;and of disgrace to the father
particularly. The mother became jealous and vexed on her son's
account that he should so [impose], and [do] many shameful
things to her husband.</p>

<p>Here follows a train of stories, the most indecent and shameful and
sometimes obscene that one can well imagine. But these people are
yet, so far as regards their faculties, in a state of
nature. Everything appears reasonable and natural and must be very
gross and palpable indeed when they do not give credit to [it].</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s6" href= "#tocs6">[Language Use]</a></h5>
<p>Their language is also that of nature, and they speak out what they
think. They do not use circumlocution to avoid an indecent term, nor
have they flourishes to embellish their discourses. And their
speeches, to my taste at least, are far more pleasing and natural than
those strained and laboured compositions we meet with amongst
ourselves. But this is not the place for these discussions.</p>

<A NAME = "p17"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="17"></SPAN>
<h4 class="section"><a name = "s7" href= "#tocs7">[Conversations]</a></h4>
<p><u>April 4th, 1823</u>. There is a sick Indian with me whom I have
been obliged to feed with his whole family all winter, not being able
to endure the cold on his lungs, and in a manner deserted by his
friends. To get as near the truth as I can possibly do in all things
relating to their mythology, I frequently converse with him on these
subjects. And when <i><u>not</u> <u>forbidden</u> <u>by</u>
<u>his</u> <u>Dreamed</u> <u>or</u> <u>familiars</u></i>, [he] is explicit
enough.  A few nights back he thus informed me upon the several
questions I proposed.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s7.1" href= "#tocs7.1">[The Figure in the Dream is Sickness]</a></h5>
<p>The one that I saw in my dream, as above related,
<u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>the</u> <u>Sun</u>, as my half-breeds told
me. The Sun is dressed like a gentleman, [in] a short coat, waistcoat,
short breeches, stockings, boots, a hat and a beautiful feather stuck
in it. He speaks English and the rest as mentioned above.</p>

<p>But the one I mentioned above, is Sickness, or the Plague. There
are four of them: two walking in the air as I mentioned, and
two <u>in</u> the earth&mdash;in the bowels of the earth at a certain
moderate distance from the surface, perhaps in the
same <u>proportion</u> as those who are above.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s7.2" href= "#tocs7.2">[Sickness Gives Warning of Diseases]</a></h5>
<p>The Indian thus relates of him:</p>

<p class="quote"> When I was a young man, he appeared to me and told
me his name was Sickness, and that every time a <u>general</u>
sickness was to take place amongst us, he would come and forewarn
me. </p>

<p class="quote">See, four winters ago (in 1819), after we had taken
debt in the fall and were proceding, each of us, to our hunting
grounds, he appeared to me one night and said, "I am come to tell you
to get out of the way of all <u>large</u> <u>waters</u> (lakes and
rivers) and pitch off immediately into the woods. Be cautious, also
select proper ground for an encamping. Never pitch your tents in large
high woods particularly of the pine kind,
chuse <u>low</u> <u>woods</u> to encamp in. And never look up to gaze
lest I see you see and you be smitten. Keep off always from large
waters, for I am on a circuit round the earth. I shall follow the
travelling waters (the routes or roads usually frequented or
navigated), and smite all those I there find with sickness. In the
interior or to one side I shall not go. Tell this to the Indians
that they keep out of the way."</p>

<p>It was that year that the <u>measles</u> made such havock in some
places. He thus continued:</p>

<p class="quote"> This last fall (in December) I saw him again. He
told me he was on another circuit and intended making a large
selection, passing through the plains and coming down again this
way. He said he would pass when the leaves would be rather large
(about the 20th June, in these parts) and told me as before to
admonish everybody to keep out of the way
of <u>large</u> <u>waters</u> [and] trees.</p>

<p class="quote">"It is not my doings, nor is it my choice that I
thus <u>prowl</u> through the earth." said he. "But I am sent, and
cannot resist."&mdash;Now we will be again this spring visited with
some sickness, but I cannot tell which&mdash;it is a breaking out in
the flesh. And his appearing

<A NAME = "p18"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="18"></SPAN>
to you (me) is a sign that he will certainly pass.</p>

<p>I then asked him if he intended telling the other Indians of
it.</p>

<p>"I shall tell my Elder (brother), but not the others, for they
won't believe me."</p>

<p>He was very diffident. He wanted to communicate to me all he was
told. But [he] said he durst not lest he should injure himself by
exasperating the other (<u>Sickness</u>) and being <u>enigmatically</u>
forbidden!</p>

<p>"He told me," continued the Indian, "as a sign, that two of our
number should die this winter: one a small one, (and <u>he</u> is dead,
naming to me a child that had died about that time, though very
distant then from him) and the other a full grown person. Whom he is I
know not, <u>but one</u> <u>must</u> <u>die!</u>"</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s7.3" href= "#tocs7.3">[Reappearances of Spirits in Dreams]</a></h5>
<p>These chaps [spirits] seldom appear (in dreams) less than four
times, but commonly six times, and each time in a different form until
the last, when he <u>makes</u> <u>himself</u> <u>known</u>. And ever
after [the spirit] appears (or rather [they] appear) in the same
uniform manner. It is then, after they have made themselves completely
known to their votaries, that they communicate their power and teach
their <u>songs</u> which, though in their dreams, are so indelibly
imprinted in their memories that they are never forgotten. For every
one of these spirits, genii, demons, phantasies, or whatever you may
please to term them, have each their <u>song</u> which they
communicate to their votaries, as well as explain also their
power. Hence it is, that when any one amongst them has dreamed of a
certain number, commonly a good many, twenty, thirty, or perhaps a
thousand, that they can <u>conjure</u> when they please. For these,
like the guardian genii in the fables, keep always near them, and
protect them from <u>too</u> much injury from the evil machinations of
some of the mischievous ones.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s7.4" href= "#tocs7.4">[Malevolent Spirits (Need for Regular Sacrifices)]</a></h5>
<p>Indeed, from what I can learn, there are but few of
these <u>familiars</u> but do do evil to their votaries if they, the
votaries, the Indians, neglect performing the regular, annual, or
perhaps more distant periodical sacrifice. And [for these sacrifices],
their <u>familiar</u> tells them what it is he expects.</p>

<h4 class="section"><a name = "s7.5" href= "#tocs7.5">[Accounts of Pahkack]</a></h4>
<h5 class="section"><a name = "s7.5.1" href= "#tocs7.5.1">[Attacks at Home and While Hunting]</a></h5>
<p> A few days ago in the night between the 31<sup><u>st</u></sup>
March and 1<sup><u>st</u></sup> April, this Indian was sleeping in an
old house I sent him to when, at a late hour in the night, he was
pulled most violently out of his bed so that his wife, that was lying
beside him, awoke and with difficulty kept him down, though he
also struggled himself to make his <u>familiar</u> leave his hold. And
the house shook violently.</p>

<p>The next day he sent me his wife to ask a little grease to make a
sacrifice. (Burnt offering. *God forgive me the comparison, which by
the bye, is not meant to ridicule, but is really the case.) I gave her
a little, and the husband came the same evening to sleep with us. Upon
enquiry, he told me thus:
</p>

<p class="quote">It was a <u>Skeleton</u>. He <u>was</u> displeased with
me because I did not make him my usual offering. And yet he knows that
I am <u>pitiful</u>, that I cannot move to hunt myself, but am
beholding to others for every mouthful I and my family eat. But they
are wicked when they think themselves

<A NAME = "p19"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="19"></SPAN>
neglected or abandoned, and think nothing of carrying off an Indian and
throwing him in some distant place, dangerous precipice, or other place
where he must perish if not succored by some other more kind one.</p>

<p >"Some years back," continued he,</p>

<p class="quote">I went out one night in the fall to hunt moose. I had
tied my canoe very securely in the rushes and there was waiting alone
to hear the moose either come to the lake, or cry after the dam, for
it was in the rutting season.</p>

<p>(And the Indians commonly go out in this manner at that season, for
the buck has a certain cry which he makes at that time, either to call
the female, or as with the domestic cattle, to exult, as one might
think, from their capers.)</p>

<p class="quote"> I all at once heard far ahead of me cries of "Heh!
Heh! Heh!" (or "Hayh!", or "Haih!") sudden, quick, coming in the air, and
directly towards me.</p>

<p class="quote"> "Oh!  Now," said I, "I am gone!"</p>

<p class="quote">Indeed he came. I <u>cringed</u> and laid myself as
low in my canoe as possible. But he came straight to me, took me up
and threw me in the water, all the time crying, "He!  He!" I then
endeavoured to take out my <u>fire-bag</u>; but this he would not let
me do. Having then no alternative, I was obliged to make for the shore
as well as I could, he all the time crying in the same manner just
above my head, as if he intended absolutely my death. However, I
reached the shore, though with the greatest difficulty. Then I took
some dry grass which I rubbed and bruised 'till it became soft and put
it under my arm pits and crumpled myself into a small heap and
remained 'till the sun began to warm when I swam back to my canoe. He
kept hovering over me all night and until the Sun was pretty high,
always making the same cry. Though when he found me so benumbed with
cold on my debarkation, he laughed, "Ha! Ha! Ha!"</p>

<p>Today (Apr. 4th) he asked me for a needle and thread to sew the
sleeve of his capot which this <u>ghost</u>!  had torn in his
endeavours to carry him off the other night. Whilst he was sewing,
"How he has vexed me," said he, "by tearing my old coat. But I am
afraid of him."</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s7.5.2" href= "#tocs7.5.2">[Making Offerings at a Hunting Camp]</a></h5>
<p>He related me another story of <u>them</u> as follows.</p>

<p class ="quote">I went out one time a hunting beaver with a friend
of mine. It was a long distance from our lodges. We killed six
beavers, and slept out. I awoke in the night and was much astonished
to observe a man seated on the opposite side of the fire, resting his
head on both hands, with his elbows on his knees apparently in a very
pensive, sullen manner. He had but skin and bone&mdash;not the least
particle of flesh; and <u>this</u> one had hair on his bony head.</p>

<p class ="quote">I gently pushed my friend and told him to look
at <u>that</u> <u>stranger</u>. We were both extremely agitated in
consequence of our fear, and were at a loss what to do.</p>

<p class ="quote">Having no alternative I arose. Conceiving he came to
ask for something to eat, I took a beaver, cut it in two and presented
him the half of it. He did not deign to look at it. I was much
afraid. I then bethought of cutting it into mouthfuls, which after
presenting him, I threw into the fire. Thus I did with the whole, and
when done, he arose and walked off peaceably in the <u>air</u>.</p>

<A NAME = "p20"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="20"></SPAN>
<h5 class="section"><a name = "s7.5.3" href= "#tocs7.5.3">[Description of Pahkack]</a></h5>
<p>This sort they term <u>Pâh-kàck</u>, Skeletons, or
such as die of hunger, or some that die extremely lean, whether from
the consumption or other sickness. These, many of them, when they have
nothing but just the mere skin and bone remaining, some of them in
this situation, disappear from the earth and go to reside with all
those who have already departed in that distressed state. This band,
or congregation, [has] a head or chief. Their color is commonly green,
though sometimes black. And it is extremely uncommon when one has even
any hair, being bald&mdash;as if a blown bladder.</p>

<p>They sometimes are heard in the day; the [noise] is sometimes as of a
quantity of dried bones rattled or shaken in a forcible manner in a
kettle. And sometimes [they are heard], as above related, making that
same monotonous but frightful cry of "He'h! He'h!" very quick and
with an abrupt termination. </p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s7.5.4" href= "#tocs7.5.4">[The Feast to Pahkack]</a></h5>
<p>The sacrifice they offer to these is grease, generally a large
bladder full, and of the best kind. All the natives present are
invited. Tobacco, of course, goes before everything else. He who makes
the feast or his assistant most commonly lights, or fills rather, the
pipes of all who smoke. But when it is [lighted], it is first
presented to that quarter where <u>these</u> are supposed to reside
(I believe in the northwest or west), then to the cardinal points, then
to the (bladder of) grease which is put in a dish fit to contain it
and covered with down.</p>

<p>Some of them have a small board about twenty or twenty-four inches
long, flat, painted with red earth, and a head made to it, of the same
piece, and flat as the rest. At a certain distance below the neck, as
we might suppose the shoulders, other small pieces made in the same
form and about three or four inches long are stuck in each side at
short distances, reaching to the ground&mdash;the lower end being
small, and the head end would bear some resemblance to the ribs or
arms were there not so many, by their being somewhat in a hanging
form.</p>

<p>After smoking and some speeches in which these ghosts are
addressed, he who makes the feast <u>waves</u> it three times crying
"He!  He!" very loud for a good many times. And [he] then presents it to
this board which is intended as a representative of the Pahkack,
desiring <u>him</u> to accept it and be propitious and merciful
to them, neither to injure them nor their <u>little</u> <u>ones</u>.</p>

<p>Then he dances three times round the tent (in the inside), and when he
comes to the fourth time, the one seated next him (in the direction of
the sun) rises. He makes a feint of offering it twice to the one who
rises, who in his turn <u>does</u> as if he was going to receive it. And
the third time it is thrown into his hands. This one makes a double turn
upon his heels and dances or <u>trots</u> once round the tent, and the [one]
next him seated rises to take it in his turn with the same ceremony
until all have passed.  Then it comes into the master's hands again who
reperforms the same ceremonies once more, puts down the grease, cuts
it up, and shares to every male or widow present, in proportion to
their numbers (the families they may have).</p>

<p>Shortly after my arrival here this last fall, they invited me through
compliment to two of these feasts. I went both times

<A NAME = "p21"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="21"></SPAN>
merely to have a better opportunity of making my observations,
which are as above, as near as I can bring them.</p>

<p>But my mind was too much disturbed with reflections which soon
became so melancholy that I had nothing to bestow on what was going
on. "Poor unfortunate creatures!" I often exclaimed to myself.</p>

<p class="quote">Ye are desirous, nay anxious, to perform your
duties to your maker, but know not how. If you only knew how he
abominates this ceremony which you perform with so much devotion! How
soon would you cast off all your superstitions, and rather live
without any religion at all, and risk all upon chance, than perform
sacrifices, for aught I know, to demons!</p>

<p>I shall not here enter upon these reflections further,
suffice the above for they are too long, too frequent. And besides,
I wish to sacrifice the little paper I have remaining to such other
things as I have, and which I think may not be quite uninteresting
to you. Had there been but their speeches and the ceremonies, I
should not perhaps have thought so deeply.  But their cries of "He! He!"
and "Ha! Ha!" [were] so repeated and vociferous, that I was struck
with a certain horror and thought that half of the devils in hell
had entered the throats of these men to give me an idea of their
pandemonium below. Good God! What a miserable reflection! But how much
moreso the occasion leading to it!</p>

<h4 class="section"><a name = "s8" href= "#tocs8">[Roots and Medicines]</a></h4>
<p>Notwithstanding, they sometimes <u>Dream</u> of roots (medicines).
There is a certain place, according to their notions, consecrated
to <u>Esculapius</u> (and perhaps Apollo also, conjointly). It is
depicted as a most heavenly abode, so delightful.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s8.1" href= "#tocs8.1">[The Abode of the Medicine Spirit]</a></h5>
<p> He (<u>Esculapius</u>) resides in a mountain, in the bowels of
which is his house. It has six doors, but so mysteriously constructed
that no soul whatever besides himself and his <u>inmates</u>, of whom
there are a great number (of every nation and language), can open
them.</p>

<p>The lock apparently is in the form of a screw, or spiral, and is
opened on the inside, but only to such as Esculapius deems worthy of
admission. These doors open <u>to</u> different quarters, the house being
immensely large and, as above mentioned, in the bowels of y<sup><u>e</u></sup>
mountain.</p>

<p><u>In</u> this residence is of every medicine useful in life such
as do not <u><b>vegetate</b></u>&mdash; minerals [and] fossils. These are
shown to the votary. He is instructed in their use, the manner of
preparing and mixing them, the ceremonies, songs and sacrifices
to be performed in their application, taking of them up, or in
instructing <u>others</u>, because it is not every <u>Indian</u> that
is favored with these dreams.</p>

<p>The mountain is of a moderate size, and there issue from it forty
rivers which fall into a lake not far from the <u>base</u> and
situated in a beautiful plain. This lake is shallow and has some
handsome sandy shoals, and in the borders of it (in the water) grow
beautiful <u>rushes</u>. The water in every one of these rivers is of
a different color, no two being alike; one is black, another white,
red, green, blue, <u>ash</u>-<u>color</u>. <u><b>In</b></u>
the latter grow herbs and plants of a vast variety, as also their
nature.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s8.2" href= "#tocs8.2">[Teaching the Medicines to the Votary]</a></h5>
<p>In the sides of the mountain are of every herb and plant
that grows in any part of the world whatever. When any one of them

<A NAME = "p22"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="22"></SPAN>
(of the Indians I mean) is thus favored, he appears first at these
rivers when the head or chief of the mountain comes out. [He] [accosts]
[the Indian] in a friendly manner. And after some conversation, he is
introduced into the interior of the house where he is astonished to
find people of every nation and language in the earth. But if I can
form a right opinion, there are but few of each language.</p>

<p>They are seated in four rows&mdash;their seats being something like
those of a theatre, semicircular and rising a little one above the
other. These are all doctors, and it is their business to instruct
the <u>votary</u> in the object of his mission. They have a great
quantity of medicines already prepared of such as are produced in the
bowels of the earth, such as minerals, stones, shells. And most, or
many of these, are hung up in the house.</p>

<p>Here he is taught how and in what manner to prepare these, as
also the songs and sacrifices appropriate to each different one or
sort.  When on the outside, or out of doors, he is shown all the
roots, herbs, plants, and is taught the respective song (of each) or
of any particular one, or number, or such only as grow in the climate
he inhabits. Both the songs and the plant, [the] herb, are so indelibly
imprinted on his mind (or memory), though he had never seen them
before, or should not happen to meet with any of them for years
afterwards, yet on his first view, he immediately recognises them and
every circumstance that had been instructed him, as if he had passed a
regular apprenticeship.  This may seem very extraordinary, if not
indeed absurd, to people unacquainted with them, but still it is no
less a positive fact.</p>

<p>These rivers, waters, are of different colors. So also is
the <u>rapidity</u> of each stream, some of them moving in a turbulent
and awful manner, as the rapids and eddies at the foot of large falls,
some moving in large majestic waves like the swells of a large deep
lake agitated by the wind, and some in a beautiful smooth current,
down which the <u>canoes</u> are scarcly perceived to move. These are
the tokens or signs or emblems of the manner of <u>our</u> lives here
below so far as regard to health and sickness.  And of course the
description requires no further explanation.</p>

<p>In some of these rivers grow herbs or plants which themselves, as
well as their roots, are a rank, deadly poison, more or less. And
their effects, when any demon-spirited wretch employs them as
instruments of vengeance, though I have known none to carry off the
object <u>immediately</u>, yet have a most melancholy, baneful
effect. Some of [these plants are] exactly similar (in their effects)
to <u>Lunar Caustic</u>, and oftentimes with an
additional <u>humiliating</u> effect (but more of this hereafter). And
some deprive the object of every one of his senses but that of
feeling. A melancholy instance of this I saw in the Spring of 1813 and
sufficient of itself to <u>[emolliate]</u> a heart of
adamant!</p>

<p>Sometimes Esculapius will not instruct his votary in their use,
satisfying himself with telling them <u>they</u> <u>are</u> <u>bad</u>
<u>medicines</u>, or perhaps not mentioning them at all. To others
again he [will explain] every <u>circumstance</u> relating to them, but
with a <u>most</u> <u>strict</u>

<A NAME = "p23"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="23"></SPAN>
injunction never to employ them at his <u>Peril</u>:</p>

<p class="quote"> ... unless you wish to die. I teach you all these
these things because I love you, and know your heart to be
compassionate. But <u>mind</u> <u>my</u>
<u>words</u>, if ever you employ them with an ill or evil <u>view</u>,
thou shalt die! Other <u>Indians</u> as well as thyself, love life. It
is sweet to everybody; render it therefore not a burthen
or <u>disgrace</u>; and I <u>hate</u> those who thus abuse my
confident affection!</p>

<p>They are also forbidden, sometimes as strictly, and for the same
reasons, instructing others in their use. Notwithstanding this great
love and cautious diffidence of Esculapius, there are other malignant
powers who teach them and encourage their use. Hence those distressing
objects I cannot here, for the want of paper, speak of.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s8.3" href= "#tocs8.3">[Stones and Their Virtues]</a></h5>
<p>What I have mentioned of minerals, which from their description are
indeed really such&mdash; minerals, yet I cannot take upon myself from
my slender knowledge of their language and <u>technical</u> terms,
to <u>assure</u> you that they are prepared after <u>our</u> manner,
by chemical processes. Mercury, sulphur, saltpetre or nitre, I do not
know that they have. But there being French, English, German, and,
from the description, Greek and Hebrew doctors among the number, I
should not suppose it preposterous in concluding that they have them
all in the same way as ourselves.</p>

<p>But from what I can learn, it is <u>stones</u>, that is some
particular kinds of them, that are most used, such as <u>talc</u>,
pumice stones and various other kinds.  These they are shewn how to
reduce to powder, and with what water, out of which river (or colored
water if you please), the water is taken to mix up these powders.
<i>With the roots and herbs it is different. <u>They</u> <u>are</u>
<u>boiled</u></i>. These <u>stones</u> (for they are most commonly
thus denominated by them) are held in very great repute by them,
though many of them that have been shewn me as possessing wonderful
virtues, I considered as very common and foolish or at least harmless
things.</p>

<p>Here!  I am again digressing, which is everlastingly the case with
me when not in the <u>humor</u> of scribbling. I should have mentioned
first (because as you may see, I have begun <u>this</u> story in
the <u>middle</u> instead [of] at either of the two ends) that when
they want to dream of these things, as well as of any other particular
thing, they must fast, and lay down to sleep, keeping their minds as
free as possible from any other thoughts whatever, and wholly bent and
employed on that particular one alone.</p>

<p>I also should have observed in the proper place that the door [at
which] the votary is introduced [through] is exactly in the middle of
these rivers, there being twenty on each side of the door. The use [or]
intent of the other five doors I never thought to enquire, and must
leave you to guess as well as myself 'till such times as I can get
this matter explained.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s9" href= "#tocs9">[Songs and Notes]</a></h5>
<p>Their songs are delivered in <u>notes</u>, impressed or drawn on
bark, in the form of hierlographics, and thus taught. And being
hierlographics, (and not very dissimilar to those anciently used by
the egyptians, nay indeed, I have reason to think from what I have
seen of both, that any <u>learned</u> man being perfectly acquainted
with the one could trace a great deal in the other, but this opinion I
hazard from my own ignorance), no two are alike. It therefore requires

<A NAME = "p24"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="24"></SPAN>
him to learn them, that is any [every] <u>one</u> of them. For those
notes are not like ours, <u>marked</u> with regular bars so that one
gamut serves for all. But with them, each one may be said to be itself
a <u>gamut</u>.  However, I have reason to think that they are regular
and uniform.  For many years ago, when I was still scarcely more than
a boy, I remember throwing away the contents of one these medicine
bags in which there were several strips of bark covered with these
notes. An Indian happened to be by. He took one up and with the point
of his knife, placing it on one of these, began to sing moving the
knife regularly as children do when they begin to learn their a, b, c.
</p>

<p>This surprised me a little at the time, for the Indian was a
stranger and had but lately arrived from his own lands that were
several hundred miles off. After laughing at and ridiculing him, as
is the custom with us, I asked how he could make them out?
</p>

<p>"The same," said he, "as you do to <u>reckon</u> (read)
your <u>papers</u>. See this one is (meant for) the <u>Thunder</u>,
that the Earth. But I only know a few of these songs. The possessor of
this bag knew a great deal. He was a great medicine man, [a]
doctor."</p>

<p> As far as I can learn, every different root, herb, plant, mineral,
spirit (or whatever you may please to term this latter) has each [its]
respective songs. And [these] they must sing, were [their] voices like
that of a choked pig, when [they] employ them for one of themselves,
or [teach] them to another. When they sing, those of
their <u>familiars</u> who instructed this song, [whether] to the one
who sings, as having learnt it from himself ([the] familiar) or having
been handed to him, [the familiar] is said to attend, invisibly of
course, and perform that which he promised this (medicine, supposing
it is one) should effect. <i>{This is a long and complex job, and I
doubt much if I can get through with it without more of my blundering.
But I shall risk blunders, omissions, and repetitions.}</i> Hence it
is they always sing when they attend on a desperately sick person
amongst themselves, though very rarely when they administer to the
white.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s10" href= "#tocs10">[Treatment of the Sick]</a></h5>
<p>When any one is very sick, and that they
be <u>called</u> <u>upon</u>, or perhaps, though rarely ordered in
their dreams by their familiars, they sing, blow and suck alternately
and with such violence that one would think they wanted to to blow
them to the d&mdash;&mdash;l, or swallow them down their throats. But no, it is
to force in the medicine of which they have generally a mouthful
masticated into a pulp, or something near <u>salve</u>, sometimes. The
suction business is to draw out the Devil: the medicine, bone, stone,
iron, brass, stick, or whatever they imagine it is, that occasions the
disease.</p>

<p>If the complaint lies in any particular part, to that part it is
they apply themselves most and sometimes <u>only</u>&mdash;supposing
the hip [or] knee, for there they imagine it is a worm or maggot
gnawing them. But if the complaint is universal, that is the whole
system be sick and debilitated, it is then the pit of the stomach and
the temples, rubbing sometimes the wrist, the palms of the hands and
opposite the heart.  This is very frequently done.  And in the
intervals the songs and rattler [are sung and played] together.

<A NAME = "p25"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="25"></SPAN>
And  often a short speech or prayer [is made] to that one of
their <u>Familiars</u> whom they think will be most propitious on the
occasion, or <u>he</u> from whom they hold such, or such
instruction.</p>

<p>These songs are a dull monotony. For though they have a few
variations and are high and low, and the [transitions are] sometimes
so very sudden that it requires a particular command of the throat to
sing them, and to <u>me</u> [are] so difficult, I should, I believe,
require a seven years apprenticeship even with Esculapius (But I
believe it is <u>Pluto</u> or <u>Pan</u> who teaches the songs.)
himself for me to learn them. There is certainly no musick in them,
though some few that I've heard many years ago, passing a winter with
them, I found pleasing enough. But perhaps more from
the <u>solemnity</u> with which all was going on was I struck than
anything else. Indeed we had great reason to be solemn, for we were
dreadfully pinched by hunger.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s11" href= "#tocs11">[Ceremonies and Songs Related to Starvation]</a></h5>
<p>When oppressed through starvation, they have a variety of
ceremonies which they perform. And though the songs be different, as
also the <u>ceremonies</u> themselves, still are they intended to
answer the same purpose. I shall endeavour to describe a couple to you
from which you may form a pretty just idea of the rest.</p>

<p>It was the latter end of January or beginning of February
1804. Four of us, only <u>white</u> people mind, were pitching off, or
rather flying off from our houses we had built in the fall on account
of <u>the</u> enemies. We had a small stock of dry provisions and
speared a few fish once or twice. But there were so many of us that we
were soon brought to short commons, as the <u>strip</u> of country we
were then going through contained no other animals but a few stragling
bears. But these animals at <u>this</u> season could not be found
notwithstanding all the exertions of our hunters. One evening on my
return to our lodges, one of the women told me that the oldest man of
our band, a great doctor, or conjurer, as we frequently denominate
them, said that if I were to pay him half a carrot (one and a half
pounds) tobacco, he would conjure and be assured of success, for it
required payment. Though I suspected there was a trick in this, I did
not hesitate but gave him his demand. The first night their songs and
ceremonies were as usual. "Tomorrow, my <u>familiar</u> tells me, we
shall get a bear."</p>

<p> All the hunters returned at evening <u>mais</u> <u>tous</u>
<u>à</u> <u>blanc</u>. The second night, the rattler, songs,
speeches, smoking, and medicine bags opened. "Tomorrow we will
assuredly get something." But the same as the day before. The third
night, the same, but everything conducted with a sort of awful silence
and solemnity that surprised me a good deal. I was harassed with
constant walking, weake through hunger, and tired with
their <u>bêtises</u> as the French say.  But the manner of their
conduct kept me that time from growling.</p>

<p>"Oh! Now tomorrow indeed, we shall not fail. We shall certainly eat
flesh for the old man is a great conjurer and well liked. He prayed to
the <u>Master</u> or Giver of <u>Life</u>, and his dreamed have
promised him success." </p>

<p>But we get no more than before.  In these conjuring boutes they
made no use of drums, but instead of that had cut a small hollow tree
of maple, about five feet long and scooped it out, after splitting so
that it resembled a semicircle

<A NAME = "p26"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="26"></SPAN>
or stove pipe split down. This <u>hollow</u> board had been well
dressed&mdash;reduced to about half an inch in thickness and well
polished. There were, to the best of my memory, four men seated tailor
fashion and held a small stick about three quarters of an inch
diameter and about fifteen inches long in each hand. With these they
beat time to the tune and another moved or shaked the rattler in the
same manner. All this however was to no purpose.</p>

<p>There was another Indian in company with us, but <u>tenting</u> by
himself (and his family). This Indian, who was very fond of me, would
frequently call me in and give me a share of what he had to
eat. "Well!" said he, "What success have your great men?"</p>

<p>I answered I did not expect much.</p>

<p>"No." replied he.</p>
<p class="quote"> They did not go the right way to work. Had I not
polluted (spoiled, as he said) my person last fall (alluding to an
Indian he had then killed) I should try. And I believe that my
familiars would be <u>charitable</u> to me. However, I shall let them
go on until they are done, after which I shall make a trial. Perhaps
on <u>your</u> <u>accounts</u> they may shew me their wonted
attention.</p>

<p>I took this as wind, but as he spoke in so very <u>earnest</u> (si
naivement) a manner, I concealed my sentiments. The second night after
the others had finished, he began a little after dusk. But what a
difference between them!</p>

<p>He had an immense large drum, as large [as] those among the
military, and stretched hard. Upon this he beat time, but very hard,
to accord with his songs which were as loud as he could bawl. At
certain intervals also he used only his rattler, but with as much
violence as he could.  Thus he continued alternately singing, praying
(or making speeches) and smoking, 'till broad daylight. When he
began we thought this fellow was mad or only jesting. But the Indians
of our lodge reproved us.</p>

<p>At sunrise he came out of his lodge, and made a long speech in
which he told one to go one way, a second another, and himself by
another route. "Thou," addressing the first one, a young lad, "thou
wilt soon find thy (bear)." </p>

<p>"But thou," addressing the father:</p>

<p class="quote">On thy way on thou wilt pass very near, but will not
see him. Thou'lt search along and return giving up all hopes. But when
come to this, thou must return again and between <u>this</u>, thy last
track and the first one thou shall make this morning, thou'lt see him
in his nest. As for me, I shall have much trouble to get mine.</p>

<p>I heard him speak, but not understanding sufficiently the language,
the women explained to me.  I need not tell you how <u>we</u> laughed
at the poor devil, and so went off hunting <u>ivy</u> which had been
our support for a long time. But in the evening we found all that he
predicted perfectly verified. This I assure you is a fact, and will
maintain it notwithstanding everything <u>skeptics</u>, (excuse the
term) or those unacquainted, or but superficially so, with these
people may say. And I am also certain that he had no previous
knowledge of their being there, for there was plenty of snow, and
there were no other tracks but those of these two hunters, [and] we
had pitched <u>up</u> (the river) that day.</p>

<p>But, here I am digressing&mdash;to return therefore.</p>

<A NAME = "p27"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="27"></SPAN>
<h4 class="section"><a name = "s12" href= "#tocs12">[Fugitive Pieces]</a></h4>
<p>I am altogether out of the regular track that I had proposed to
myself at my first setting off. My time is too short and my memory too
bad to read over the whole so as to resume the regular course. The
remainder shall be composed of <u>fugitive</u> <u>pieces</u>. Indeed
the nature of some of them being a <u>compound</u> will not admit of
their being <u>treated</u> of but in <u>sections</u> if I may use the
term.
</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s12.1" href= "#tocs12.1">[The Soul]</a></h5>
<p>The first therefore, lest I have not time to <u>enter</u> all, I
shall speak of is <b>The Soul</b>! This seems, to me at least, a most
extraordinary and incomprehensible thing. Yet from the different
sources which I have received it, and the manner of relation, serves
but more and more to perplex. Whether it is really and absolutely the
soul, or some other <u>principle</u> on which the very existence
depends, I cannot say. But something it is, lodged apparently in the
heart or breast, that on these occasions flies off and leaves them,
and at the very instant of its exit it is perceived. And [the
parting] occasions such a derangement of the whole system, and
particularly of the faculties, as very soon to deprive the object of
life, but [primarily causes] a total want of sense, such as we suppose the
soul <u>endows</u> us with.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s12.1.1" href= "#tocs12.1.1">[An Attempt to Capture a Soul]</a></h5>
<p>I shall here relate you one of the many stories of the kind,
verbatim, as I received it.  It was from an Indian, of course. He told
me that one summer, being on a visit rather to a distant part of the
country (perhaps two or three hundred miles [distant]), he fell in
with one of his acquaintances who (as often happens between
strangers, particularly to such as come from the southward) asked to
purchase <u>medicines</u> of him.</p>

<p class="quote">I had but a small quantity, and only of four sorts or
kinds.  He being very anxious for them, I sold them <u>all</u> to
him. He was not satisfied. He must have more, though I positively
assured him I had given him the last. Then he menaced me, and said I
should feel the effects of his resentment arising from my avarice
and <u>uncharitable</u> spirit.  Knowing his disposition, I returned
to my friends, intending to be as far out of his way as possible.</p>

<p class="quote">One night in the winter he conjured. I was fast
asleep (and several hundred miles off) and never thought more of
him. But he called upon his familiars and demanded my soul!
<u>It</u> <u>was</u> <u>taken</u> to him. But just as it was on the
eve of entering his conjuring hut, I perceived it and sprang from my
bed in the most dreadful agonies and convulsions, insomuch that two
men holding and pulling of me with all their might, and [who] also had
the assistance of the women, could not keep me quiet. I was constantly
springing forward, rushing hither and thither and absolutely (totally)
deprived of my faculties, for I have not yet the least knowledge of
what I was doing, so great was my horror in observing this conjuring
tent.</p>

<p class="quote">At last a friendly spirit interfered and forbad the
conjurer at his peril to do anything to my soul, but allow it to
return immediately. He was afraid for his own life and durst not
disobey. He let <u>it</u> go.  I cannot tell you how happy I felt and
so easy. The distance was great indeed, but I soon flew back and
reentered my body, when I became entirely composed.</p>

<A NAME = "p28"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="28"></SPAN>
<p class="quote">But I had been so dreadfully agitated that I found
myself in a profuse sweat, my whole frame so shaken, debilitated, and
weake, that for several days I could not move but with pain.</p>

<p class="quote">"Heh!" said I, "What a narrow escape!"</p>

<p class="quote">The other Indians asked what ailed me? I told them
where <u>I</u> had been. They would scarcely credit [it]. But in the
ensuing summer, upon enquiry, they found it true, and were now fully
convinced that this power doth lodge with Indians!</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s12.1.2" href= "#tocs12.1.2">[Representation of the Soul]</a></h5>
<p>They represent the soul as being small, not very dissimilar in size
and shape from the yolk of a large hen or duck egg. Some of them
[are] very hard, and much of the nature and substance of a stone, but
still not of that substance. And others again [are] much more soft and
tender. Some are easily <u>kept</u> and bruised, but others are with
difficulty taken and continually in motion. But all are extremely
impatient of restraint and cannot bear it. Confinement is death to the
body from which it has issued!</p>

<p>Some conjurers possessing sufficient power and influence take a
soul if they want to destroy the body, (in the conjuring box or tent),
and wrapping it in a piece of leather, rub and bruise it between both
hands 'til they destroy its subtility or subtilty. As soon as it comes within view
of the conjuring tent, its agonies are terrible, as also those of the
body, however distant that may be. But as soon as its motion is
destroyed, the body dies likewise.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s12.1.3" href= "#tocs12.1.3">[Imprisonment of a Soul]</a></h5>
<p>Others again take it and put it in a japannd tobacco box and tie
the lid or cover securely with a <u>woman's</u> <u>garter</u> from
whence, if not loosened by someone, it can never escape. Any other
lashing is not anything near so completely effectual as this.
Reflect and you will guess immediately the reasons they give. As I do
not know Latin and you don't understand Indian, I must suppress this
and many other things. Others again take a different method thus. But
by-the-bye, this has but very little relation to the soul. I shall
therefore refer it until afterwards and give you another story as
received from a Canadian, an eye witness.</p>

<p>He was passing the winter with the Indians, and one night the head
man of the tent he lodged in gave a feast. He was in the habit of
doing it and was himself apparently a good and peaceable man, but not
to be trifled with by other Indians. Everything being prepared, the
guests were just going to eat when the feast-man's mother dropped
suddenly as if dead. Everyone was struck with consternation.  They had
recourse to their medicines, songs, rattlers as usual. At last he fell
to sucking his mother in one of her temples.  Suddenly they heard
something <u>crack</u>. The Indian drew back, his mother arose
perfectly recovered and all became well. However, that which
occasioned the <u>crack</u>, the Indian took out of his mouth, wrapped
carefully up and gave it to his wife to put in a tobacco box, which
she did. It had all the appearance of a <u>bean</u> (une fève).
The wife wanted to tie the lid, but the husband said there was no
necessity. They resumed their meal.</p>

<p>But the old woman was not long in possession of her senses. She
very soon relapsed, and as instantaneously as at the first. "Ho!"
exclaimed the Indian, "The <u>Dog</u> is off." They looked into the
tobacco box but nothing was found. They continued conjuring three
nights and the last [night] especially. The man told me he thought the devil

<A NAME = "p29"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="29"></SPAN>
was amongst them from a certain kind of undescribable noise in the
air round about their tent and the sudden flashings of light. This
was powder (gun powder). They had carefully thrown out all the fire,
thrown a great quantity of snow and water on the hearth, and then put
fresh earth upon it. It was perfectly dark in the lodge, there being
no other light than what is usually emitted from the heavens. Upon
this hearth of fresh earth they would throw some powder and then
retiring to the bottom of the tent would say, "Come! Let me see if I
be a manito?" then singing. Off the powder would fly!</p>

<p>They continued this way three nights, but all to no purpose. The
old woman yet lived two years but never spoke.</p>

<p>He said (the Indian) that this <u>bean</u> "... was the soul or
spirit of another Indian, then at a vast distance, which he darted at
my mother to render her pitiful and miserable. But I shall make the
dog suffer."</p>

<p>However, after this, the Canadian enquired why he did not revenge
himself and kill him.</p>

<p>"No," said he, "that won't do. He has got back his soul it is true,
and I cannot get it again. Yet I might easily kill him if I chuse,
but this won't do. He is somewhat [justified] for I took both his
wives from him."</p>

<p>There are many other instances of a like nature, but different in
the proceedings, that I do not recollect sufficiently to commit to
paper.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s12.2" href= "#tocs12.2">[Medicines Used to Harm Others]</a></h5>
<p>Now again for the other way: If an Indian has a spite against
another and is induced to it for the preservation of his own life or
from motives of revenge, he takes the following plan or method. He
takes a piece of leather and cuts it into the shape of
his <u>enemy</u>.  And if he wants him to die speedily, he places a
little <u>powdered</u> <u>medicine</u> opposite the heart, or upon
it. This medicine is, I believe, a root and very inflammable. He
holds a small spark of fire <u>near</u> it. It
immediately <u>explodes</u>, and that part of the leather on
which <u>it</u> was becomes burnt and shrivelled. When he performs
this, he generally utters words like these, "Let the heart
of <u>such</u> <u>a</u> <u>one</u> become like this leather. Let it
shrivel and die within him!" </p>

<p>If it is a leg, an arm, the head, or any other particular part, or
parts or even the whole body, it is the same, and the words also,
unless he doth not wish for the death. Then he will say, "Let
<u>such</u> <u>a</u> <u>part</u>, become lame, useless, ulcerous,"
according to his disposition. And that part, or parts become thus
affected according to his wish. </p>

<p>"But how is it possible that such things can be?  Do you really
think that an insignificant root of no apparant power or virtue
whatever can effect such things?" Thus I would frequently question.
And their answers with little variations [were] universally the
same.</p>

<p> Yes, most certainly it is not [accomplished by] the root alone, but
with the assistance of that one of his dreamed that is most powerful
and most fond of him. "He! You white people, you know not. You are
consummately ignorant of the power of our great medicine men. Many
things might I tell you much more surprising. But you do not believe
these trifles&mdash;how much less then those [things] you do not
know?"</p>

<p>What then is to be done! How do with,

<A NAME = "p30"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="30"></SPAN>
what say to, a people so blind, so infatuated!</p>

<p> They have some roots that are dreadful in their effects. To being
a female, I think I should prefer immediate death! They have some that
have the same effects as <u>Lunar</u>
<u>Caustic</u>. They use them thus: During the time of their
"seperation" (menstruation) they endeavour to give them to smoke,
which is never refused. There is some of this root mixed with the
tobacco. One smoking is sufficient. A few months after, their
complexion begins to change, and at last becomes of a
<u>nasty</u> black with abundance of hair growing out of the face.
And if these women were to shave, I verily believe their beards would
become as bushy and thick as those of any man whatever.</p>

<p>In performing this they must also utter words thus. "Let the one
for whom I intend this, and who shall smoke of it, become black and
hairy, and become as ugly and rejected as she is now fair and searched
for!"</p>

<p>Sometimes they mingle it with their food or the liquor they drink.
There is more than one kind of this dreadful root, one of which I was
shewn but have forgotten, there being two or three others resembling
it. It is like many others, a perennial herb, and hath some
resemblance to the long or tall thistle.</p>

<p>To return: When the subject or object discovers that she hath been
thus dealt with, which they sometimes do a few weeks after, they may
be restored for there is an <u>antidote</u> to it. But I have never
known one instance of this, though a dozen of the others I have. Some
handsome, fair complexioned, young females refusing the importunate
sollicitations of an abandoned, vicious, revengeful wretch become the
victim of [their] <u>coyness</u>. And two or three years after, I have
positively not known them and could scarcely believe my eyes.</p>

<p>There is of another kind [of root] and which is very common, whose
effect is an extraordinary <u>vacuation</u> of blood and [which] in a
few days would occasion death.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s12.2.1" href= "#tocs12.2.1">[Used Against a Woman]</a></h5>
<p class="quote"> A half breed I lately had with me, the son of a man
who many years ago was a servant of yours, being not of an
extraordinary good moral character, finding his solicitations rejected
with scorn, became jealous and very anxious to revenge himself. He
applied to an old Indian, but in so cautious a manner that the Indian
gave him of the root without suspecting and told him how to use it. He
pulverised it, and mingled it with a little vermillion, and then
watched his opportunity which occurred, I believe, the ensuing
morning.</p>

<p class="quote">In our <u>outposts</u> we have no temples dedicated
to Cloacinda.  And, besides, the females here are ashamed
to <u>sacrifice</u> at them. He therefore could not miss his
opportunity. He watched, and after she entered, he went and soon found
the place by the <u>Smoke</u>.  Here he sprinkled some of this powder
which he took in a quill, pronouncing, "Let me see blood issue from
the same place <u>this</u> hath done. I want to see blood."</p>

<p class="quote">Scarcely five hours after, the woman who was married,
and of course so much the less bashful, said, "What is the matter with
me, I have been just now out and want to go again." You may suppose
her astonishment seeing the time of the natural return was scarcely
half elapsed.

<A NAME = "p31"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="31"></SPAN>
But how much more so, finding it issue far beyond anything she had ever
known. This continued 'till very late in the day.

<p class="quote">And the beast was watching to see if it would
answer. He went in to the house on pretence of a friendly visit and
remarked how <u>pale</u> she was. The mother told him, "My daughter
has been <u>bewitched</u>, and could you not do something to ease
her?"</p>

<p class="quote">He became extremely uneasy in his turn. He went out,
and passing by the place she went to, he easily discovered,
notwithstanding her precaution, of what dreadful consequences it would
be if not timely attended to. He was afraid she would die before
anything could be done. However, he went to the old Indian and
speaking in a most sympathising strain asked him if he could not
administer something to stop that extraordinary issue.</p>

<p class="quote">"Why!" replied the old fellow, "That root I gave you
the other day is its own antidote. Give her the length of her middle
finger to
<u>eat</u> and it will stop quick enough."
</p>

<p class="quote">He did not chuse to tell the Indian that it was this
that had occasioned it, lest he should be punished by him in his turn.
But artfully conducting his discourse, [he] got more from him,
administered it to the woman muttering in himself, "Let this blood
cease, I have seen enough of it." And she was soon healed!</p>

<p class="quote">I done all I could to make him confess it, without
coming to the point. But he never would. He satisfied himself by
assuring me with the most solemn assertions that it was the case. "And
if you doubt it," continued he, "you may make the experiment. You need
be under no apprehensions whatever, for in giving her of the same root
to
<u>eat</u>, it will stop."</p>

<p> This root, when mastigated and applied when reduced to pulp, but
better when pulverised, stops the blood immediately on application to
any wound&mdash;<i><u>how</u> <u>profusely</u>
<u>soever</u> <u>it</u> <u>may</u> <u>flow</u></i>. It is very
astringent and somewhat hot.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s12.2.2" href= "#tocs12.2.2">[Wild Carroway]</a></h5>
<p>Another herb, I believe it is the (wild) carroway, which we
commonly denominate aniseeds&mdash;at least the smell and taste much
resemble that. And its stalk bears a very great resemblance to the
wild mint, as well as the leaves and flowers. I <u>suppose</u> this is
the one meant, because they tell me the taste and smell are
delicious. This root and all its appurtenances (stalk, leaves and
flowers) is of wonderful effects in various <u>things</u>. I shall
give you some of the stories relating to it as I received them.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s12.2.2.1" href= "#tocs12.2.2.1">[Used in Hunting]</a></h5>
<p class="quote">I was living out with <u>such</u> an Indian, and we
became reduced to <u>short</u> <u>commons</u>. One day he (the Indian)
took a piece of bark and drew upon it three moose, and put some of
this <u>medicine</u> upon the heart and head of each. Then he fastened
a piece of sinew to it, and told me to fasten it to a small stick that
had been stuck <u>slant-way</u> in the Ground.</p>

<p class="quote">"Now," said he, "let me see if this will do. Oh no!
I am afraid it won't. But I'll try. If it answers, the bark will
dance!"</p>

<p class="quote">I laughed at his idea (a half breed told me this) and
so did one of his sons. However, the son told me that he had seen his
father do so before, and that he killed every time.</p>

<p class="quote">"Stop! Let us see how he will go on." said the
son. The father began to sing (and if <u>I</u> remember right, beat
the drum also). Shortly after the bark began

<A NAME = "p32"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="32"></SPAN>
to move, and as the old fellow raised his voice, so did its motion
increase, 'till at last it began whirling round with great violence,
sometimes one way and then another, 'till it was wound up close to the
stick, when it began changing sides&mdash;sometimes <u>upon</u> &amp;
sometimes <u>below</u> the stick.</p>

<p class="quote">He ceased, began to talk with us and saying he was
afraid it would not <u>answer</u>. Thus he did three times, and the
bark moved every time with the same violence. Now he desired, in the
beginning, that if his <u>familiar</u> would have compassion on him,
he would render these three moose foolish that they might not be
possessed of their usual cunning.</p>

<p class="quote">The next day we went out, the old man, his son and
myself, a hunting. We were hungry; we walked till late in the day, and
finding no tracks, I proposed our return. But he told me we ought to
proceed, for in the low ground beyond a small ridge then near in sight
of us we may perhaps find some tracks. "I am never deceived when I am
answered (my bark dances)."</p>

<p class="quote">We soon reached this low ground and shortly after
heard a noise: jumping, running, and breaking of sticks. "Ah! Here
they are!" said the old man. "See how their <u>head</u> is turned!
What a noise they make, how they play. They are foolish."</p>

<p class="quote">We killed them all.  If you doubt me, ask any of the
Indians, and see if they won't all tell you that <u>he</u> does so
when he wants to kill.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s12.2.2.2" href= "#tocs12.2.2.2">[As Love Potions (Baptiste's Stories)]</a></h5>
<p>Another story: for <u>love</u> <u>potions</u> or philters are
also composed of this.</p>

<p class="quote">There were several young men (half-breeds) of us
together, and also some young women who came with us to await the
arrival of their husbands from Fort William at <u>that</u> place. Two
of our party wanted to pay them a <u>visit</u> in the night.  And I
endeavoured to dissuade them, but to no purpose. They went, and met
with the reception I foretold. They began bawling out, and on purpose,
to awake every one near and shame us, for we were lodging by
ourselves. And then [they] took good cudgels and pursued them into our
place. <u>We</u> enjoyed this confusion of the others though partly at
our own expense.</p>

<p class="quote">One of them then addressed me. "Come Baptiste,
this <u>bitch</u> has vexed me. I know you
have <u>good</u> <u>medicine</u>. Give me some of it that I may laugh
at her in my turn." (I must tell you that one of them I have known
many years back was, and is still, a <u>bitch</u>&mdash;i.e. according the
Indian acceptation (as well as our own) of the term. And the man is
the same one I mentioned little above, at the conclusion and beginning
of p p. 30 and 31.)</p>

<p class="quote"> I gave him some with the <u>directions</u>. He
returned again very soon after (in the same night) [and] found her
asleep. He then rubbed her forehead, opposite her heart,
the <u>pit</u> of the stomach, and the palms of both hands. Then he
awoke her. The next day as my comrades were desirous of revenging
themselves, they broached the conversation publicly and had the laugh
in their turn. The women had the <u>best</u> at the offset, but as
they could not deny the other charges, they became extremely confused
and vexed. A quarrel ensued, but my comrads exultingly told them, "We
can turn and twist you <u>now</u> about our fingers as we please!" And

<A NAME = "p33"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="33"></SPAN>
they did too. For the women both <u>giving</u> <u>suck</u> at that
time, thought it was their children that were handling them, as they
used but <u>one</u> finger, and gently.</p>

<p>The other story is thus.

<p class="quote">A man that I have with me at present, in consequence
of some <u>slips</u> of his <u>rib</u>, had frequent and some severe
quarrels with her. She began to hate him and wanted to go with
her <u>paramour</u>. The husband though vexed and
confused <u>did</u> <u>not</u> <u>want</u> to lose her. He began by
soothing, coaxing, and caressing her. But she always bawled out as
loud as she could that everybody might hear, though it were at
midnight, "Thou white dog! Leave me alone. Why art thou fumbling at
me?" </p>

<p class="quote">The more she became averse the more he coaxed, and
she bawling out, "Don't <u>slabber</u> me!" every time he attempted to
kiss her. And she was watching a fair opportunity to slip off to her
lover (an Indian).</p>

<p class="quote">At last he lodged his complaints to me and asked if I
could not <u>assist</u> him. I gave him some of this <u>medi</u>cine
with the usual directions. And [I] told him as soon as he had executed
all properly, to come away and leave her and not return to her for a
couple of days so that in her turn she might suffer.</p>

<p class="quote">He had not long left her 'till she called for him as
if wanting something. And like a goose he went immediately, though I
done all I could to make him pay her in her own coin.  Since that time
they live as you see them. <u>But</u> if you doubt of this also, you
can easily make the experiment. Chuse any one you please, and let her
be ever so coy, and shy, you will bring her as you want!!!</p>

<p class="quote">Shortly after this I made some general enquiries of
the man latterly in question. But he would not avow [to it], though
from his confusion and [the] precipetency with which he answered, I
believe there is <u>something</u> in the business.</p>

<p class="quote">It is with this medicine (continued the half breed)
that the young men do completely and universally succeed with all the
women that please them. </p>

<h4 class="section"><a name = "s12.3" href= "#tocs12.3">[Effecting and Avoiding Spells]</a></h4>
<p>With this also, principally, they succeed in bewitching any one
they are averse to, and prevent them from killing such animals as they
please. They draw the likeness of the animal or animals they do not
chuse the others to kill, put of this medicine (though most commonly
mixed with some others in this latter case) upon the hearts, and
desire that they may become shy and fly off upon any the least
appearance or approach of them. Or they will <u>conjure</u> and
desire some of their <u>familiars</u>, one or several,
to <u>haunt</u> <u>such</u> <u>a</u> <u>one</u> in all his motions and
scare and frighten off and <u>render</u> <u>wise</u> any <u>such</u>
and <u>such</u> animals&mdash;and let the distance be hundreds of
miles off. Their familiars, that are spirits residing in the air, and
transport themselves in an instant to any place they [please], and who
see all that is going on <u>below</u>, keep <u>all</u> away
accordingly.</p>

<p>To evade this is a task that but few can succeed in. They must
first conjure to learn who it is that has bewitched them. Then they
inquire what is to be done. But here lies the difficulty.  Sometimes
they are told they <u>must</u> leave the appointed time run out; at
others [perform] such and such ceremonies, which is tantamount to the first
answer; but at others again, it is easily dispelled. This

<A NAME = "p34"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="34"></SPAN>
depends entirely upon the precautions the<u> bewitcher</u> has taken;
the power, influence, or number of his dreamed; as also on the other
hand, the dreamed, their power; [and on the] influence of the
<u>bewitched</u>.  But sometimes on a very slight or trivial cause
depends the whole.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s12.3.1.1" href= "#tocs12.3.1.1">[The Old Canadian's Account]</a></h5>
<p>I shall tell you another story. An old Canadian I have now with me
has been in the habit of <u>living</u>-<u>free</u> for many years
back. In the beginning of a winter he was tenting with some Indians,
and one of them, an impertinent, bombastic sort of character, was
boasting to him of the great power and effect of some medicines and a
drum he had lately received from a Sauteux. </p>

<p class="quote">For some time I did not mind him, but finding he
became at last troublesome, and insinuating as plainly as he durst
that <u>he</u> was now invulnerable, or rather immortal, and
that <u>we</u> were helpless, a quarrel ensued 'till at last, "I
fxxt. upon your medicines and drum and the one also who gave them to
you!" said I. </p>

<p class="quote">We seperated in no good friendship. At night he made
a feast and invited me amongst the rest with the design of poisoning
me. But his friends remonstrated so effectually that he put this off
and intended shooting me going out of the lodge. But this also the
others would not allow. He was vexed. I kept my eye upon him,
determined I should give the first blow on the least motion he might
make. Finding himself prevented in these, he said that I indeed should
kill two moose, but that the rest of the year I should starve as a
dog.</p>

<p class="quote">I seperated next day with my wife and children. They
were under great apprehensions, but I mocked all their conjurings. I
very shortly killed two moose, but these indeed were the last. I
walked and hunted every day. And seldom one day passed but I fired at
the buffaloe, moose, or some other animal, but never got anything,
anything!  I and my family were near dying with hunger.</p>

<p class="quote">I tried everything in my power, never giving myself
the least trouble about the Indian's menaces.  At last the spring
arrived. Ducks and geese came, but no better success. At last one day,
prowling in my canoe, I met two other <u>free</u>-<u>men</u>, [one of
whom], after mutual inquiries, told me the same thing had happened
him.  And [he said] that an Indian told him to file off a small piece of
the <u>muzzle</u> of his gun and wash it well with water in
which <u>sweet</u>-<u>flag</u> had been boiled. And [it] killed after
that as before.</p>

<p class="quote">I laughed at the idea. But reflecting that it was an
innocent experiment, and I could not offend the Almighty, I tried. And the
first animals I saw I immediately killed. This sir (continued he) I
assure you is a positive fact!!!</p>

<p class="quote">I find that the Indians have recourse to this method
also. But you must observe: as is the disease, so is the remedy.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s12.3.1.2" href= "#tocs12.3.1.2">[The Iroquois' Account]</a></h5>
<p>Another story just now occurs to me which I shall relate, not so
much to multiply these pretended proofs, as to show that our Iroquois,
Algonquins [and others] are not such complete converts to the
Christian faith as most people may complacently imagine. But rather
[they] have a mongrel religion like those whom the King of Babylon
sent to inhabit Samaria when he carried Reuben and Ephraim captives
(in the Bible).</p>

<p>This winter an Iroquois

<A NAME = "p35"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="35"></SPAN>
told me that one winter he was out a beaver hunting with many of his
friends. The oldest man of their party proposed one day that a certain
number of them should go out a hunting moose or buffaloe, and the
others beaver. This one says:</p>

<p class="quote"> I returned at night after a good success&mdash;the
old man nothing. He became envious, a quarrel ensued, and after this
many others. One day I fired at a moose as he was running past me. He
fell. I went to him, and just as I was for beginning to skin, he rose
up, but with my axe I brought him down. It was very far from home. I
merely opened him and returned light, trusting to the others of our
party, for I had no desire of partaking of the dry provisions the old
fellow had of his own. Immediately on entering the lodge, we had
another severe quarrel, and he told me I should not any more exult in
my prowess as he should take care I should not kill any more animals
for <u>some</u> <u>time</u>.</p>

<p class="quote">As we were coming to <u>knife</u> <u>work</u>, I
ordered my wife to bundle up all our things and my lodge, and pitch
off. It was then late, and I had not yet eaten. As none of my friends
knew that I had killed, I did not chuse to tell them, but merely said
as I was going off.  "Let those who are fond of me, or who chuse,
follow me." But none came, and I encamped upon my moose.</p>

<p class="quote">Every day I went a hunting. Scarcely a week passed
but I fired twenty, thirty, and sometimes upward of fifty shots upon
buffaloe or moose but could never kill. I would <u>miss</u>,
or <u>the</u> <u>ball</u> <u>twisting</u>
<u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>hair</u> <u>would</u> <u>fall</u> <u>by</u>
<u>the</u> <u>animal</u> without doing further injury. I starved for a
long time and became so weake that I could hardly walk.</p>

<p class="quote">At last my wife, a woman of this country, one day
that I had been out as usual had prepared some good strong lye, and
on my return, washed my gun with it, filled it, and stopping both the
orifices, put it over the smoke where it remained all night. She also
took a number of the balls and boiled them likewise in the lye,
telling me she had seen her uncle do so many years before when he too
had been bewitched. I thought, at all events, it could do no harm.
And besides, I could have done anything I was so hungry.</p>

<p class="quote">The next day I went out again [and] found another
flock or herd of near twenty buffaloe. I drew nigh and took all my
usual precautions. I fired, one dropped; [I] fired again, another
dropped. I killed fourteen out of that herd, and ever after missed not
once!</p>

<p> I asked him how the old fellow had done [it].</p>

<p>He said, "I suppose it was as they frequently do: bury a piece of
my meat in the ground and pray the Devil to prevent my killing. For
the Iroquois, when they take it in their head, are very wicked and do
not want power!"</p>

<p>A few days ago a half-breed abandoned with the Indians came in.
And amongst his other <u>wantages</u>, [he] asked me for a small piece
of (red) sealing-wax, "... because my brother cannot draw blood from
the animals he fires at. By heating his gun and applying this wax the
blood will flow profusely from the wounds." He expressed himself
afraid that his brother might have been bewitched, and by retarding
this operation he might enter <u>dans</u> <u>sa</u> <u>mal</u>

<p>These few <u>examples</u> will suffice to shew you that they have

<h4 class="section"><a name = "s13" href= "#tocs13">[Stories of  the Hairy Breasts and Nayhanimis]</a></h4>
<h5 class="section"><a name = "s13.1" href= "#tocs13.1">[North Wind's  Challenge]</a></h5>
<p>I shall now give you of the <b>Story of the Hairy Breasts</b>.
Near the days of <u><b>Noah</b></u>, nations were few and small.
Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k (Noah, I shall call him for abbreviation sake) had a
son, as I told you before, whose name was Nay-hân-nee-mis [Nayhanimis]. Being
strait'ned for provisions, he went out to angle with some of the
Hairy-Breasts. They came to a lake, pierced several holes, but the
North (or North Wind, as you chuse) being envious of Nayhanimis
froze the water down to the very ground so that in the deepest parts
they found but earth. And after much digging, at last [they] reached
the bottom.  But behold that also was frozen&mdash;and who knows to
what depth in the Earth!</p>

<p>Finding this to be the case Nayhanimis, addressed his friends
thus.</p>

<p class="quote">I see this is the doing of the North Wind. (Now by
rights the North Wind ought to have been his maternal Grand
Father&mdash;but what cannot envy do?) He is envious of us and wants
to make us die of hunger. But he shall not! I have to propose to you
to cut off my head, rip up my body, beginning at the throat. You must
not hurt nor break any single one of my bones, but carefully take off
all the flesh, dry it, and make pounded meat of it.  Of this you must
sprinkle a little in every one of the holes.  You must
also <u>chop</u> up my heart into very small pieces and throw a few of
these pieces also into each hole. Then put in your lines, and you'll
take as many fish as you please. But my bones you must put in a heap,
carefully by themselves.</p>

<p class="quote">Mind! Upon your faithful observance of all
these commands depends our mutual safety. The North thinks himself
sole master, and would wish to crush us because we begin to have a
little knowledge. But he shall know me!</p>

<p>They [did] accordingly, and accordingly also they took abundance of
fish. North perceived this. He came to see, and finding himself thus
frustrated, inquired how it came about. They told [him]. He challenged
Nayhanimis who by this time had revived. And besides, a beautiful
large feather he had sticking in his cap, or head, which none durst
wear but such as have given incontestible proofs of their manhood
[and] bravery. He likewise had a smoking bag of the skin of a
badger. Nayhanimis accepted the challenge. </p>

<p>"It seems, Nayhanimis, you are a great man, a man of extraordinary
power and abilities! Let us have a trial, and see which of us has the
most, for I also have some knowledge."</p>

<p>Nayhanimis answered, "No! I have but little power. But that little
I employ as much as I can to the general benefit of my fellows. Let us
see what you can do, which if I cannot, then you will certainly be
superior to me."</p>

<p>Here they performed one or two wonderful feats. But in [these]
Nayhanimis had the advantage most confessedly. The North pierced his
body through, and [did] another extraordinary thing I cannot well
recollect. But the other [did] more and recovered not only more
suddenly but more perfectly.</p>

<p> At last the North put a bet and said, "Let us see for this last
act. I will cut off my head, and if I cannot replace and recover

<A NAME = "p37"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="37"></SPAN>
perfectly, the same as I am at present, then my <u>house</u> and all I
have shall be yours. But if I succeed, and you cannot, then all
your <u>possessions</u> shall be mine."</p>

<p>Nayhanimis consented for he was secretly desirous of humiliating
the self-sufficient spirit of North. They tried. North failed, but
Nayhanimis completely succeeded. He deliberately severed his head from
his body, put it down on the ground beside him very composedly, and
then replaced it, when it became as though nothing had happened. But
this was owing to the power and virtue of his <u>plume</u> which,
however, the others knew nothing of.</p>

<p>It appears that the North also recovered but by the assistance of
his friends, of whom he had a numerous train. North was faithful to
his promise. [He] gave him his house which was beautiful and spacious,
but mostly underground, or at least in the side of a mountain. All
[North's] friends turned out, put in Nayhanimis and gave him the full
possession.</p>

<p>But he was no sooner in than they secured all the outlets: doors
[and] windows. And [they] set it on fire to destroy one whom they
found so much more powerful than themselves!  Nayhanimis, finding this
to be the case, was not in the least dismayed, but took his smoking
bag and thus addressed it. "Now <u>thou</u>, Badger, our mutual safety
depends upon thy obedience and expedition. Thou art made to
pass <u>through</u> the earth as [<u>quickly</u>] as <u>upon</u>
it. These fools think to destroy us, but thou must show that we are
superior to them."</p>

<p>During the conflagration they were enjoying the scene and exulting
in the idea of having at last succeeded in destroying so formidable an
adversary. But what was their consternation when they saw him come to
them without even one hair of his head singed! They
were <u>appalled</u> with astonishment, and had not the power of
utterance.</p>

<p>At last, recovering a little, they endeavoured to pass it off as a
joke and turn it to his own advantage, by silencing at one blow the
envy and malice of <u>all</u> his enemies, pretending to be
staunch friends of his. But he was not thus to be duped. Yet he
showed a superiority of sentiment and generosity, equal to his powers
and abilities, by giving them (though <u>contemptuous</u> if you
please) pardon.  So much for this <u>Part</u>.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s13.2" href= "#tocs13.2">[Nayhanimis Wars with the Hairy Breasts]</a></h5>
<p>Thus did matters pass on for yet a few years. The <u>Indians</u>
began to <u>multiply</u> and inhabit the world. But the Hairy Breasts,
a jealous, envious, and at best foolish people, could not well
behold <u>their</u> prosperity. They made <u>war</u> upon them
(the <u>Indians</u>) by stealth and destroyed numbers. Their affairs
bore a most dismal aspect&mdash;[The Hairy Breasts wished for] no less than the
total extinction of the whole race.</p>

<p>At last Nayhanimis pitched off with his wife, <u>her</u> <u>father</u>,
and another one. There were four of them. He found a Beaver lodge. Here
some of the <u>Hairy</u>-<u>Breasts</u> came up with him: compliments at
first, afterwards sneers, taunts and revilings&mdash;but so ambiguously
[given] that no hold could be taken.</p>

<p>"How numerous, how many are there of ye?" inquired [one of] the
Hairy Breasts.</p>

<p>"We are twenty of us." replied Nayhanimis; </p>

<p>"And so are we." rejoined the others. </p>

<p>Now they here entered into an arrangement that whoever
found <u>Beaver</u> for the future, it should be his own. But to avoid
any wrangles, he who <u>found</u> the Beaver should plant a stick or
branch upon the lodge as a mark. On their return

<A NAME = "p38"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="38"></SPAN>
home, each recounted to his family what he had met with in the course
of the day.</p>

<p>"Now," said <u>Nayhanimis</u> addressing his family, "we must take
twenty beavers, one for each man of them (meaning the Hairy Breasts)
and make a feast. If it turns out that we be able to eat these twenty
beaver, and they not, then we shall be superior to them and have the
upper hand."

<p>The beaver were cooked accordingly. He took his <u>rattler</u>
which he shook to the tunes of his songs, performed the usual
ceremonies, and they ate the whole twenty beavers with ease. Then
addressing his family thus said, "These Hairy Breasts are great
boasters, but cowards. They are a people of no account.  Tomorrow will
decide all."</p>

<p>The Hairy Breasts on their return did the same as Nayhanimis and
cooked also twenty beavers, thinking that his band did really consist
of that number. They ate, but every one was already full and yet more
than three quarters of the feast remained. "Give me my rattler," said
one of the oldest, "that I sing. It may happen that we find
grace."</p>

<p>He sang and shook his rattler, but it would not sound. After
frequent repeated trials to no effect, he became vexed and threw it
out of doors among the dogs. "This dog of a rattler will not sound in
spite of all my endeavours. But hold! Hear how it rattles now that it
is out. Go for it one of ye! Perhaps it was owing to some fault in
me."</p>

<p>They brought it to him. But [it was] still as before; he threw it
out again in a rage. It was no sooner out than it sounded [as] well as
before. It was brought in again, but as before, again. Then he threw
it out for good, vexed and disappointed to the utmost degree. But his
friends were not pleased. They considered this a portentious omen and
his behavior foolish, and by no means calculated to reconcile
their <u>Deities</u> to them. He comforted them by telling them, "The
numbers of the adverse party must be few. Otherwise we had surely
been able to <u>eat</u> the whole of this feast. They are few and
we <u>shall</u> subdue them."</p>

<p>The next day they all pitched off. Nayhanimis came first to a
beaver lodge and marked it. [He] came [to] another and marked that one
also. But making a circuit, in which he hung up his bow [and] quiver
in a tree at his own height, came round to the same lodges and found
that the Hairy Breasts had put marks of their own and thrown his one
away. Exasperated he threw theirs away and replaced his. And [he]
made another circuit, when he found the Hairy Breasts had replaced
their own again. He also remarked that the Hairy Breasts had hung up
their bows <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>tops</u> <u>of</u> <u>very</u>
<u>high</u> <u>trees</u>, trusting to their numbers.</p>


<p>At last they met, greeted each other at first, then sneers,
quarrels, a challenge and then the battle. They were to
fight <u>man</u> <u>to</u> <u>man</u>.</p>

<p>Nayhanimis killed nineteen right out, but the twentieth had near
killed him.  However, this was but an accident usual in battles. He
soon killed him also.</p>

<p>The women were coming up when, raising his voice to a pitch to be
distinctly heard by all, [he] said:</p>

<p class="quote">Such of ye <u>Indian</u> women as have been taken
from your homes [and] had your husbands killed, such of ye Indian women as
are willing to return to your nation, take all axes and others arms
out of the hands of these Hairy Breast women. Seperate yourselves from
them; attack

and destroy them <u>all</u>. Leave not one alive to carry the news to
the others.</p>

<p> They seperated accordingly and killed every soul.</p>

<p>Then he took them to his tent and [found] by their answers to his
queries that there [was] still another band, not far off, consisting
of forty young and two old men of the Hairy Breasts.  He ordered a
quantity of poles or pickets to be cut very long, and made a kind of
fort of them round his own tent. And [he] gave orders to them to
gather a vast quantity of snow round all the sides of it to come over
the points, so that neither the pickets nor tent might be seen, and
that this rising might have the appearance of a natural hill&mdash;
something in short in the form of a pit. He immediately made a number
of lances, and spears and walked off in quest of his enemies.</p>

<p>He soon reached their camp, drew near, and found that there were
but two old men. All the others were out a hunting. Here he listened
to their conversation and was burning with indignation at the stories
these two old men told each other of the cruelties they had done to
the <u>Indians</u>. They were chuckling at this when he sprang into
the tent, took each by the head and thrust their faces [into] the fire
and sprang out again to listen.</p>

<p>One of them, returning to his senses, for they had both fainted
during the ceremony, exclaimed thus, "My old friend! What is the
matter with me? I lost my senses quite suddenly and now that I am come
to, I feel my face quite sore and cannot see."</p>

<p>"It is the same with me." replied the other one</p>

<p>"Then it must be some evil spirit that has pounced upon us."
resumed the first.</p>

<p>At last Nayhanimis addressed them thus,</p>

<p class="quote"> I shall tell ye old men a story too.  There were two
old men formerly seated in their tents relating to each other the
exploits of their younger days and the cruelties they committed upon
the <u>Indians</u>.</p>

<p class="quote">Nayhanimis was near. He pounced upon them and thrust
both their heads together into the fire. When your children and young
men be returned from their hunting, tell them this story. In the
meantime I shall return home and make ready for them. My name
is <u>Nayhanimis</u> and I reside at <u>such</u> a <u>place</u>
(i.e. I am <u>called</u> (or named) Nayhanimis ...).</p>

<p>The old men, as may be imagined, were thunderstruck with this and
durst not say a word more. But in the evening the young men came
home. They were astonished to see their fathers in such a plight.</p>

<p>"Children! Behold your fathers!" said they. "Had
any <u>miscreant</u> durst act in such a manner to <u>our</u> fathers,
their villany should certainly not have passed off
thus. <u>But</u> <u>we</u> <u>are</u> <u>now</u> <u>old</u> <u>men</u>
<u>and</u> <u>of</u> <u>no</u> <u>more</u> <u>account</u>!!!"
</p>

<p>This last apostrophe above all the rest roused them to
vengeance. They merely scraped the snow off their feet and legs and
went immediately in quest of him vowing vengeance all the way of a
most cruel and <u>exemplary</u> nature.</p>

<p>Nayhanimis was on his guard. Every soul able to wield a weapon had
one in his hand, besides an infinite number of spears and sharp stakes
stuck in the ground. The Hairy Breasts came, but not perceiving the
trap on account of the snow that was brought over [the] ends of the
stockades, they all fell in, one upon the other, and impaled
themselves in their fall on these sticks. All of them but two or three
met with instantaneous death. The few that were not injured were put

<A NAME = "p40"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="40"></SPAN>
to an excruciating but immediate death to satisfy the <u>manes</u> of
the departed <u>Indians</u>. And he proceeded immediately to the camp,
killed the remaining two old men, scoffing and taunting them at the
same time. Immediately after this he ordered such of the <u>Indian</u>
women as had had their husbands killed, or were taken by the Hairy
Breasts, to seperate from the other women and inflict the same
punishment upon them and their children as had been done to their
friends.</p>

<p class="quote">Thus were the Hairy Breasts entirely [extirpated]
merely by their own folly and wickedness. Had they lived peaceably,
and allowed the <u>Indians</u> to partake of the blessings of this
world without envy as well as themselves, and to which they had an
undoubted right, they might still have been in existence.</p>

<p class="quote">However, there are still two nations of them, one of
which is on <u>your</u> lands, the others, I believe beyond the
seas. But they are an insignificant and most despicable people. They
pretend to antiquity and would fain extort respect from the
<u>moderns</u> (i.e. themselves, or the Indians, <u>principally</u>).
But their very countenance, appearance, everything about them denotes
folly, and seems more to demand contempt than to call for respect. I
saw one many years back, who was brought by the traders from somewheres
on your lands. [His] face was venerable, but still there was a meanness
in the <u>whole</u> of him that I could not account for. I respected
him, and wanted to treat him accordingly. This is as from the stories I
had heard related of them. But the traders laughed at <u>us</u> and
asked one if I was inclined to respect folly, insignificance, and
nothing!!!</p>

<h4 class="section"><a name = "s14" href= "#tocs14">[Notes]</a></h4>
<p>I have been a long time in writing these pages, and have been
frequently disturbed. I have been often obliged to put by my paper
after seating myself five or six times to write only one word. From
such long and frequent interruptions <u>much</u> method and

form of <u>notes</u>.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s14.1" href= "#tocs14.1">[Motives for Writing the Journal]</a></h5>
<p>My motives for thus employing my time and paper were first to amuse
and instruct myself, but principally for your own amusement and such
few friends as you may think <u>worthy</u> of the
communication. <u>Lend</u> <u>them</u> <u>not</u> <u>[out]</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>house</u>, nor let too many see them, for I have some notion,
please God I live, to digest them into form and regularity, and have
them published&mdash;besides a vast many others I [propose], with God's
help, collecting. But this is merely between ourselves, and
immediately after perusal blot out all <u>this</u> paragraph.</p>

<p>Journals [and] voyages of these people have been frequently
published. But I have met with none that gives so circumstantial a
detail of their private life (if I may so say) as is necessary to give
that insight to their ideas and notions (and this latter term too, I
think, critically speaking, cannot be applicable to them) that is
required, and so much wanted, to form a proper estimate of man in
his <u>natural</u> state.</p>

<p>We all see them, hear them and relate of them. But where is there
one who can give the <u>whys</u> and <u>wherefores</u> that these
people do so and so?  I beg you will <u>blot</u> this last paragraph
entirely out, at least the first part. And do not be premature in your
condemnation or judgement of me, for I trust my motives are entirely
destitute of vanity, and only the desire of truth urges me, or at
least [the desire for] true and just information. G N April 16th 1823.

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s14.2" href= "#tocs14.2">[Comments on
Aboriginal Beliefs]</a></h5>
<p>Such are the notions and ideas of these people. They acknowledge a
superior power, not Wee-suck-&#257;-j&#257;&#257;k, as I was erroneously
informed, <i>but the same <u>one</u> you adore in the Christmas
holidays</i>. This one they have a great respect and veneration
for. But seldom it is, as far as I can learn, that they sacrifice or
pray to him, make speeches, which, though extempore, <u>I</u> consider
as much prayers as though they were composed after the most deliberate
and mature reflection. And many parts of them [are] so simple, plain,
natural, and withal so sublime, that I frequently felt great pleasure
in attending to them.</p>

<p>But these sentiments are so few comparitively speaking, and the
absurdities so great and frequent, that few men can hear them without
lamenting their ignorance. They have often seemed to me as desirous in
a high degree of becoming acquainted with the true <u>mode</u> of
worshipping, from the frequent changes, even during my time, they have
made in their <u>worshippings</u>. As a proof of this is the avidity
with which they seize any new system introduced from
their <u>southern</u> neighbors, the short time they hold it, and how
completely it is abandoned, if not entirely forgotten for another
equally, if not more, absurd than the former. To introduce a new system
among them, it is only necessary to report an extravagant tale of some
wonderful character, the cures by <u>this</u> means that have been
performed, and such like miraculous and fantastic nonsense. But in
their fundamental points I perceive no visible alteration.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s14.3" href= "#tocs14.3">[The Mee-tay-wee]</a></h5>
<p>The principal of these is what they call the Mee-tay-wee, a
ceremony I shall compare to freemasonry. But the initiations are
public. Every one that chuses comes to see them, and many are
invited. Here, in the course of initiation, are ceremonies or
deviltries performed that no man of his own mere dexterity or
power <u>can</u> do.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s14.4" href= "#tocs14.4">[Conjuring]</a></h5>
<p>The next principal one is conjuring. This is a principle I believe
as natural to man as the air he breathes (though not <u>so</u>
necessary).  Everyone wishes to peep into futurity, and there are few
but who would not inquire into causes could they do it, or were it not
forbidden them. These two, of course, are consequences or consequents
of their mythology. There are many in the civilized or Christian world
who absolutely and positively deny this power of theirs as being
absolutely impossible and at best [believe them] but absurd and idle
stories.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s14.5" href= "#tocs14.5">[Evidence of
Spirits through Conjuring Practice]</a></h5>
<p>Many of the things related of these conjurings I acknowledge to be
so. But at the same time I am as positively and as firmly persuaded of
the truth of the assertion <i>that they have dealings with some
supernatural spirit,</i> as I am convinced that I live and breathe in
air. [That is] unless, indeed, we chuse to acknowledge and believe a
certain sect of philosophers (of the last century I believe)
who <u>wish</u> to tell us that we <u>only</u> <u>imagine</u>
<u>ourselves</u> <u>alive</u>.  And I am by no means inclined to
acknowledge myself as superstitious. I am convinced of this from
reason, argument, comparison&mdash;in short, from <u>analysis</u>.
Let any one man, unless he be a headstrong brute who is
<u>determined</u> beforehand not to be convinced, analyse their
<u>discourses</u>, and I am confident he will believe as much as
many, or have great doubts at least. To absolutely deny this, we must
first deny that there is a Devil, and afterwards deny his pernicious
power.

<A NAME = "p42"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="42"></SPAN>
And if we deny these points, we must descend to a third, and [one]
more fit for an atheistical wretch and a beast than a Christian, or
even rational creature. I have heard some sensible and well informed
gentleman deny it on the plea of their <u>ignorance</u>. But this
again is <u>a</u> basis and very solid one.</p>

<p>These people are still in a complete state of nature. Their ideas
of the true God are far from clear or correct. They acknowledge Him
indeed as the supreme and absolute master of all, but more, or rather
as, a passive <u>deity</u> [more] than as he really is. But their
notions of their other deities came far more near the truth.</p>

<p>Their wants indeed are also few, but they are arbitrary and cannot
be dispensed with, at least for any time. It is therefore very natural
that they should employ their whole thoughts and most of their time in
procuring these means to warding off or averting their dangers.  And I do
not know of any method more adapted to this than the one they pursue:
fasting and sleeping to dream. And they do dream too. And many of
these dreams are so complicated, or compounded of so many different
things that it is absolutely beyond the power of <u>their</u>
invention to fabricate them.</p>

<p>Surely a man may believe his senses.  A man tied, wound up in a
blanket or skin equally soft. Here he is held by one, two, or three
men. He slips out of the blanket and presents himself before you
free, leaving the cords  <u><b>untied</b></u> in
the blanket. You hear him speak, and perhaps twenty other voices
besides, all at the same. Again, he is bound as a criminal, rather
indeed as a pig, crumpled into a heap and thrust into his <u>hut</u>. At
the very instant of his entrance, the hut shakes as if ten thousand
devils were for pulling it to pieces. You enter this, find the man
absent, hear a fluttering about your ears or see a vast number of
small lights resting on the hoops that hold the poles together.
</p>

<p>Immediately after you are out, you hear the man speak within again.
You look again and feel for him, but hear him talking at a distance.
What can this be but supernatural agency? I have never seen feats of
<u>this</u> kind, but others I have, not so <u>strong</u>, but equally
convincing.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s15" href= "#tocs15">[Conjuring Ceremony for a
N. W. Co. Gentleman]</a></h5>
<p>I have been informed that a young half-breed, abandoned with the
Indians almost from his childhood, a few years back entered one of
these conjuring <u>huts</u> at the solicitation of one of the North
West gentlemen to see what retarded the people so long. Previous to
his entering a great deal of conversation on the subject had been
[taking place]. Matters were settled between them and the
conjurer. Some time after his entrance, he began to cry (not weep) as a
person uneasy. At first the voice was within, but it appeared as
rising in the air, and at last was lost.</p>

<p>"Well!" said one of the Indians, addressing one of the half-breeds
living with the white. "Well! Enter now, and see if he be there.  Thou
art always doubting and denying what we say of these things.  Enter
then, and see if he be there. Then indeed are our assertions
false."</p>

<p>He raised the bottom of the <u>casement</u> and entered. But as he
was not below, he rose on his feet and felt for him, but [the conjurer
was] not to be found. However he was <u>paid</u> for his
curiosity. There was a dreadful fluttering within, but especially
about his head. His hair [was] flying about in his face as if in a
tempest, and [there were] frequent appearances of small lights before
his eyes whichever way he turned. He bawled out and asked those
without what was the matter with him. He became afraid
and <u>walked</u>

<A NAME = "p43"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="43"></SPAN>
out as quick[ly] as he could.</p>

<p>Very shortly after, they heard the same cries of pain, faintly at
first, but the voice soon entered. The <u>conjurer</u> said he was
carried to where the people were. "They are all asleep, at such a
place and tomorrow will be here." He said there were four (spirits) of
them, that carried him off. Each held him by the <u>little finger</u>
and <u>little toe</u>!</p>

<h4 class="section"><a name = "s16" href= "#tocs16">[Stories]</a></h4>

<p>I shall here relate a couple more of these stories. </p>
<h5 class="section"><a name = "s16.1" href= "#tocs16.1">[The Hunter and the Wolf Spirit]</a></h5>

<p>An Indian told me that several years back he left his lodge on the
borders of a large lake to go to the house for some necessaries he
wanted. He took a traverse for some islands. The weather was dull but
mild. A storm very soon set in. But he persevered. Thinking the wind
had changed, he also changed his course. He became very much fatigued
and laid down on the ice to rest himself and wait for daylight, for
the night had overtaken him. He was not long down before, reflecting
on his situation, he became extremely uneasy and was afraid of
freezing. </p>

<p>At last he heard a curious noise near him that he could not account
for. At first his fears increased, greatly dreading it was some
malignant spirit. But having no alternative he resigned himself to his
fate. </p>

<p class="quote">And I became as composed as though I were safe.  And
I was too, for an animal much resembling a wolf, and black, came up and
covered me. I was very cold, shivering in every limb, but I soon
became quite warm. He rose from off me and went on as if inviting me
to follow. His eyes appeared like two candles. I followed.</p>

<p class="quote"> He led me to an island where I made a fire and
warmed and dried myself. And as soon as I was rigged, I followed him,
for he went off and looked at me so earnestly I took it for an
order. He led me straight to the water hole. There happened to be
people at the time there going for water. They saw <u>these</u> lights
and asked me what occasioned them, or who it was that came with me. I
told them it was a compassionate spirit that retrieved me from a
dreadful death.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s16.2" href= "#tocs16.2">[Pursuit by a Pahkack]</a></h5>
<p> <b>Second [Story]</b>! A young man lately told me the following.</p>

<p class="quote">I was returning home with my uncle when come
to <u>that</u> point, we heard something crying behind us, "He! He!
Ha!  Ha!"  and whistling alternatively.  My uncle told me it was a
Pah-kack (Skeleton), and [it] wanted to destroy us. It came up with us
very soon and kept constantly buzzing and whistling in our ears so
that, indeed, we were quite bewildered at last. It was at night and
dark, but we kept straight on as we thought. We were mistaken for,
after walking a long time, we at last came to the water hole again
from where we had set off.  We were both of [us] much afraid, but finding this
path, we minded it no more though it pursued us making more and more
noise the nearer we got home. </p>

<p> Many of these stories bear a great resemblance to those
extravagant tales of la Béte a la Grande Queue, Loup Garoup, Chasse
Galerie and many others natural to superstitious people. It requires,
therefore, a great deal of caution and attention to get at the true
ones. I have here <u>inserted</u> more than I originally intended, but
they will serve to give you an idea of the notions of these people,
and, except a few, I have selected those that appeared most rational.
<u>However</u> <u>they</u> <u>will</u> <u>all</u> <u>come</u> <u>in</u> <u>time</u>.
</p>

<A NAME = "p44"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="44"></SPAN>
<h4 class="section"><a name = "s17" href= "#tocs17">[Wetiko]</a></h4>
<p>There is a kind of disease (or distemper rather, and of
the <u>mind</u>, I am fully persuaded) peculiar to the Crees and
Sauteux, and of which they have the greatest dread and horror. And
certainly [the fear is] not without the very greatest cause&mdash;the
consequences, forty-nine times out of fifty, being death unfortunately
to many besides the <u>subjects</u> or objects themselves. They
term <u>this</u> Wen-di-bgo (according to the French pronunciation,
which is more correct than the English, in this word)&mdash;the proper
signification of which, to me at least, and no one I think can doubt
it, is <u><b>Giant</b></u> of the Anthropophagi <u>Genus</u>, sect,
tribe, or kind.</p>

<p>The stories related of these are as extravagant and fantastatic as
those we read in our old romances <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>days</u>
<u>of</u> <u>chivalry</u>. [They differ] in no one circumstance hardly
but the means used in their destruction which, of course, is often
done by the intervention or assistance of their guardian
genii. However, there are some few more rational than those
of <u>ours</u>, and though still beyond all bounds of credibility, are
as devoutly believed by these poor creatures as the Gospel is by the
most orthodox among us. I do not remember any of these sufficiently
correctly to give you a few of the stories, one excepted.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that they are of uncommon size. Goliath is an
unborn infant to them. And to add to their <u>dread</u>, they are
represented as possessing much of the power of magicians. Their head
reaching to the tops of the highest <u>poplars</u> (about seventy or
eighty feet), they are of proportionate <u>size</u>. Of course they
must be very heavy.  Their gait, though grand and majestic, at every
step the earth shakes. They frequently pursue their prey
(<u>Indians</u> of course) invisibly. Yet they cannot so completely
divest themselves of all the incommodities of nature as to prevent
their approach being known. A secret and unaccountable horror pervades
the whole system of one, several, or the whole band of those of whom
he is in pursuit. [There are] phenomena in the heavens [and]
earth.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s17.1" href= "#tocs17.1">[Trapping a Wetiko]</a></h5>
<p class="quote">In the days of <u>Noah</u>, (or near them at least)
there were a large party of <u>Indians</u> collected together for
mutual safety. Many camps had been already destroyed by him, and the
Indians were in great danger [of] being entirely exterminated.</p>

<p class="quote">At last they bethought themselves of a plan. "It is
needless to go to war upon him. What can we do to him with our arms!
Let us make an immense large trap (of wood) and draw lots [for] which
of us shall serve as bait. It is a dangerous assay indeed, but will
any generous one amongst us refuse sacrificing his life for the safety
of so many?"</p>

<p class="quote">They made this trap on the opposite side of a small
opening in the woods, so that he might see the person seated from
afar. It was between large trees which were made to serve
as <u>posts</u>.  It was finished.</p>

<p class="quote">An old woman stepped up and said, "My Grandchildren!
I am now old and of no more account among ye. We are all in danger of
being devoured by this insatiable and terrible beast. Why should I
then regret sacrificing a life that, at best, I can now enjoy but only
for a short time, seeing it will in the end be productive of so much
good?
<u>I</u> <u>will</u> <u>go</u> <u>and</u> <u>be</u> <u>bait</u>."</p>

<p class="quote">The others were extremely touched at her generosity,
but they had no alternative, and circumstances admitted of no
delay. The old lady seated herself very

<A NAME = "p45"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="45"></SPAN>
composedly in the trap and awaited his arrival. The others fled off of
course. It was time too, for he soon <u>hove</u> into sight, stalking
along in all the stile and terror of imperial grandeur. His head
[was] equal with the tops of the highest trees, and the ground [was] shaking
at every step, though frozen, it being then depth of winter. And his
countenance denoted an assemblage of pity, contempt, rage and
voraciousness.  All this did not dismay the old lady; she remained
quiet.</p>

<p class="quote">He perceived her. "What! What, old woman, art thou
doing there?" But changing his tone, which he did several times, thus
continued, "Thou art of my natural enemies and I shall presently grind
thee."</p>

<p class="quote">"Ah! my grandchild! I am an old woman, abandoned and
deserted by those whom I have suckled and brought up. They are fled
off in dread of thee, and being old and helpless, they thrust me in
this tuft of trees so as to be the less embarrassed. Come now and
assist me out, and in acknowledgement I shall inform thee of their
precautions. Otherwise thou'lt lose thy life by their deceptions."</p>

<p class="quote">He was in no dread of the <u>Indians</u>, so far as
regarded their <u>own</u> power, but he thought a little salutary
advice would not be amiss, intending after this to <u>grind</u> the
old <u>thing</u> as he had promised himself.</p>

<p class="quote">He drew up. "What a devil of a place they have put
thee indeed. Did they think to conceal thee from me?"</p>

<p class="quote">He stooped to enter. When she found he had entered
far enough, she touched a stick. And down came all the weights and
cross bar upon his back. Though he was uncommonly strong, the weight
and suddenness of the blow was such that he gave way and was jammed
between the two beams or bars. Here he struggled denouncing [and calling
for] vengeance and eternal destruction to the whole of
the <u>human</u> race.</p>

<p class="quote">The great bellowing he made was a signal to the men
who were in ambush not far off. They came running up and soon
dispatched him with a multitude of blows from axes and chisels.  Thus
were they, for <u>one</u> <u>time</u>, relieved.  The women and
children returned to the camp and enjoyed themselves as usual without
further apprehensions.

<p>These giants, as far as I can learn, reside somewhere about
the <u>North</u> <u>Pole</u>. And even at this day, [they] frequently
pay their unwelcome visits, but which, however, are attended with a
complete fright only.</p>

<p>It seems also that they delegate their power to the Indians
occasionally. And <u>this</u> occasions that cannibalism which is
produced or proceeds rather from a sort of distemper much
resembling <u>maniaism</u>.
</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s17.2" href= "#tocs17.2">[Habits and Types of Wetiko]</a></h5>
<p>There are three sorts or kinds that I know of, and believe there
are no more.  The first I have already related as above, and the two I
am going to give you are sometimes <u>compounded</u> together and
sometimes <u>independent</u>. But they are both equally true and
melancholy and distressing in whatever light we may view
them. However, I shall not pretend by any means to palm <u>all</u>
that is said about them upon you as true. Of this you'll by and bye be
able to judge as well as myself, and not doubt.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s17.3" href= "#tocs17.3">[Those Driven to Cannibalism by Starvation]</a></h5>
<p>The first of these are such as are driven to this dreadful
extremity by starvation. In all <u>woody</u> countries where the
inhabitants lead a wandering, roving life and whose subsistence
depends upon the game they procure, they must of necessity be
frequently pinched and sometimes brought very low. All <u>people</u>
cannot bear this privation alike. And though there is perhaps not

<A NAME = "p46"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="46"></SPAN>
a people in this world who take this so patiently as these people do,
yet there are not wanting instances where, even with them,
that <u>nature</u> gives way. They vanish as a <u>dying</u>
candle.</p>

<p>But others cannot stand it out so long; they must have something to
eat, be it what it may. Sometimes, though with the most extreme
reluctance at first, they feed upon the flesh of such
as <u>have</u> <u>died</u>. Any kind of animal substance, at such
times, must come very grateful to the stomack. And hence it is, I
believe, that those who have once preyed upon their fellows ever after
feel a great desire for the same nourishment. And [they] are not so
scrupulous about the means of procuring it. I have seen several that
had been reduced [to] this distressing alternative. And though [it be]
many years after, there appeared to me a wildness in their eyes, a
confusion in their countenances much resembling that of reprieved
murderers.</p>

<p>Now, if we consider how very precarious their mode of subsistance
is, how devoted they are to superstition and prejudice, we&mdash;such
of <u>us</u> as know more about them&mdash;we, I say, may wonder how
they stand out so well. Very many instances I have known seem to be
far beyond the power of human nature to stand.</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding this dreadful privation lasts not for a few
days, but even to weeks and months, during all of which time the men
are out from star-light to star-light and have never anything more
to <u>eat</u> than some bits of leather, moss, bark and such like, it
is very rare they will kill a <u>fellow</u> to live upon him. This is
not universal. There are unfortunately still too many exceptions, but
these again would seem as denounciations from their gods. They appear
so to me&mdash;I can scarcely doubt it! And the Indians themselves
seem to think the same, though in another way. </p>

<p>At this place where I am now writing (Lac La Ronge, English River),
but a few years back, several instances occurred. An old canadian is
said to have lost one of his sons thus, though an excellent
hunter. The old man sometimes speaks to me of that son. And the second
died on his way to the house, and not far off. The same year an Indian
killed all his family but two daughters whom he compelled to partake
with him, and for the rest of the route he ...........</p>

<p>I shall here give you a few stories of the kind. </p>

<p class = "quote"><u>That</u> same year (I do not know precisely

the answers [were] vague, indefinite and contradictory. They handed
her something to eat. She acted as if eating it indeed, but let the
whole fall in the <u>inside</u> of her gown. This [roused]
suspicion. But what added to this was the extraordinary stench she
emitted from the heat of the chimney. And shortly after her entrance,
a part of a human shoulder [was found]. The dogs brought [it] in from
upon her road. She went off, being directed upon a road leading to a
camp not far off.</p>

<p class = "quote">As soon as she made her appearance, the Indians
immediately conceived what was the matter. But through charity, as
well as for safety and to find the truth, they gave her to eat,
principally marrow-fat.  Now these people pretend that cannibals
cannot bear this fat or grease. Of course it was a kind
of <u>ordeal</u>.</p>

<p class = "quote">Everything she did and said, notwithstanding her
great caution, betrayed her. She took up [one] of the children of her
acquaintances to

kiss, as is customary, but would have given it a bite had they not
taken it from her. They watched her narrowly. All the men slept in one
tent with her. She pretended to be asleep 'till she imagined the
others were, then rose very cautiously, and was beginning to prepare
herself for <u>action</u>. One of the men perceived this, rose upon
her with an axe. Though the blow was violent, and upon the head, she
would have killed him had not the others interfered. Her wretched fate
was soon decided.</p>

<p>There is such a singular, strange, incomprehensible
contradictoriness in almost all these cases. And many I have heard,
that I do most verily believe they are <u>denun</u>ciations, witch, or
wizardisms. In any other manner they are not rationally to be
accounted for, unless we suppose all those who feed on human flesh to
be thus possessed. Then it is natural to man in these cases. But why
then not the same with us as with these people?</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s17.5" href= "#tocs17.5">[Those who Dream of Ice and the North]</a></h5>
<p>The third kind&mdash;or delegated which by what follows, I believe may
be allowed to be the term&mdash;[is made up of] those who dream of the North or the
Ice or both. Everyone knows where the North resides, but only few
know the abode of Ice or the Ice. This they pretend is the parent of
Ice. [It] is in the bowels of the earth, at a great depth and never
thaws. All ice originates from this. These two they are much afraid of
because they are both highly malignant spirits. There is no joking or
jesting with them. Those who at <u>any</u> future period are to become
cannibals thus dream of them.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s17.6" href= "#tocs17.6">[Dream Feasts Of Human Flesh]</a></h5>
<p> After the certain things usual in all dreams:</p>

<p class="quote">I was invited by the North to partake of a feast of
ducks, the most beautiful I had ever seen and well cooked. The dish
was before me. I set <u>to</u>. A stranger by me touched me with his
elbow and said, "Eat not thou of that, look into thy dish!"</p>

<p class="quote">Behold that which I had taken for the wing of a duck
was the arm of a child! "He! What a narrow escape!" said I.</p>

<p class="quote">Then he took me into another room and gave me most
excellent meat, the most delicious in appearance I had ever seen. I
would not eat. I discovered it was the flesh of <u>Indians</u> thus
served up to me! He took me into a third room and gave me
tongues. These I also perceived were the tongues of Indians.</p>

<p class="quote">"Why refusest thou what I offer thee? Is it not
good?" </p>

<p class="quote">"I feel no inclination to eat." I replied. </p>

<p class="quote">Then he took me in a fourth room where fine
beautiful <u>hearts</u> were served up, and I was desired to eat.  But
I perceived that it was still the same. I therefore refused.</p>

<p class="quote">Then said he, "It is well done. Thou hast done
well!"</p>

<p class="quote">Heh!  Had I unfortunately eaten of this, then had I
become a cannibal in addition to all my other misfortunes.</p>

<p >Those who eat at these feasts are frequently, but not universally
told thus:</p>

<p class="quote">This is a sign to thee that thou shalt one day become
a cannibal and feed on the flesh of thy fellows. When thou shalt see
children play with and eat ice (or snow) <u>in</u> thy tent, say,
"My time is near." For then thou shalt soon eat <u>Indian</u> (human)
flesh.</p>

<p>They have such dread and horror of this that it is constantly in
their minds. </p>

<p class="quote">You white people! [You] who live at your ease, get
your living out of your nets or from your Indians, and besides are not
otherwise troubled as we, make light of these things. I do not make
much account of them either. But I tell you that he who thus once
dreams of either of those dogs are for ever after continually troubled
with them.</p>

very fortunate! You live as you please; never care for him; nor does

<p>Such I am told are the <u>sentiments</u> of these
people in general.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s17.7" href= "#tocs17.7">[Behavior of Infected People]</a></h5>
<p>I look upon this as a sort of mania, a fever, a distemper of the
brain. Their eyes (for I have seen [them] thus perplexed) are wild and
uncommonly clear; they seem as if they glistened. It seems to me to
lodge in the head. They are generally rational except at short, sudden
intervals when the paroxysms seize them. Their motions then are
various and diametrically contrary at one time to what they are the
next moment: Sullen, thoughtful, wild look[ing] and perfectly mute,
staring in sudden convulsions, [they use] wild, incoherent and
extravagant language.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s17.8" href= "#tocs17.8">[An Account of Survival]</a></h5>
<p>There was one a few years back infected with this not far from
where I was at the time. The accounts given of him, though I shall not
vouch for their truth, are thus.</p>

<p class="quote"> One night towards the latter end of December he
began staring at his daughter with an extraordinary intenseness. </p>

<p class="quote">"My daughter! I am fond of thee! I love thee
extremely!"</p>

<p class="quote">"I know thou dost." replied the woman abashed, for
she was then very young.</p>

<p class="quote">"Yes! I love thee. I think I could eat a piece of
thee, I love thee so much."</p>

<p class="quote">The girl exclaimed at his rashness. There were but
three of them: the father, daughter and her husband.</p>

<p class="quote">When it was dark he put himself stark naked. And
uttering a strong tremulous noise, and his teeth chattering in his
head as if through cold, [he] rose up and walked out of the tent and laid
himself, curled as a dog in a heap, upon the wood that his daughter
had that day brought to the door. Here he remained all night in spite
of what they could do. A little before day he returned. Thus did he
every night for about a month, and every time slept out naked. Nor
would he eat, excepting at times a little raw flesh. In the daytime he
was more composed, but his face bore the appearance of one possessed
of the Devil. He recovered and became as usual&mdash; composed, and good
natured. I knew them all well, but had no dealings with them from the
year before (1812).</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s17.9" href= "#tocs17.9">[Executing a Wetiko]</a></h5>
<p>A young Indian a few years back had <u><b>one</b></u> of the above
dreams. He became very uneasy and thoughtful finding it recur so very
frequently. And he would have willing undergone any torments, any
death, rather than become an anthropophagi. He also frequently desired
his friends, upon any the least appearance of these symptoms in him,
to kill him. "For if you do not kill me 'till I have eaten
of <u>human</u> flesh, you'll perhaps not be able to do it afterwards.
But my children! Oh! my children!  How grieved am I to leave ye! But
it must be so; I have no alternative. Spare me not my friends, I
conjure [sic] you!"</p>

<p >He had been a good hunter and a peaceable Indian and, of course,
much loved by his friends. This business depressed them a great
deal. At last, the time approaching fast, his brother one day remained
behind with him to watch him whilst the others pitched off. About the
time this one thought the others had finished the encampment, he
proposed their setting off to join them. But before long he left his
brother behind and laid an ambush for him

<A NAME = "p49"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="49"></SPAN>
not far from the tent. This was a preconcerted scheme; the other men,
of course, were not far off.</p>

<p>The sick one drew near in a very slow and thoughtful manner.
However, when he came near to where his brother was hid, he stopped,
looked up and called out, "Thou thinkest thyself well hid from me, my
brother, but I see thee. It is well thou undertakest [this]. It had
been better for thee, however, hadst thou begun sooner. Remember what
I told you all. It is my <u>heart</u>; my <u>heart</u> that is
<u>terrible</u>, and however you may injure my body, if you do not
completely annihilate my <u>heart</u>, nothing is done."</p>

<p>The brother was sure that he was not
discovered&mdash;this <u>knowledge</u> being the information of some
of the spirits. He therefore did not answer. Some of the other men had
gone to meet him and endeavoured to amuse him, that the brother might
give the first blow. Accordingly he shot&mdash;straight for the
heart. He dropped but rose immediately and continued towards the camp
that was within sight, laughing at their undertaking. <i>The ball went
through and through, but not a drop of blood was
seen&mdash;<u>His</u> <u>heart</u> <u>was</u>
<u>already</u> <u>formed</u> <u>into</u> <u>Ice</u>.</i></p>

<p>Here they seized and bound him, and with ice chissels and axes
set to work to dispatch him. According to his desire they had
collected a large pile of dry wood and laid him upon it. The body was
soon consumed, but the heart remained perfect and entire; it rolled
several times off the pile. They replaced it as often. Fear seized
them. Then with their (ice) chissels they cut and hacked it into small
bits, but yet with difficulty was it consumed!</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s17.10" href= "#tocs17.10">[Treatments and Recovery]</a></h5>
<p>They fancy that blood which circulated through the heart first
turns into water, then coagulates or congeals, and shortly after
becomes into solid imperforable or impenetrable ice. The only antidote
or remedy for this is to give them large draughts of high-wines,
double distilled spirits, or the spirits of wine, if any can be had
the better. This taken in large draughts and frequently
and <u>kept</u> beside a large fire flows to the heart and thaws the
ice. If a profuse sweat ensues, it is a happy omen.</p>

<p>An Indian with me this winter gave out his apprehensions that he
was thus tormented. I communicated it to two others who happened to
come in about that time.</p>

<p>"Why do you not give him large draughts of your strongest spirits
to drink and keep him in the room beside a large fire?"</p>

<p>I replied that I was afraid it would burn him.</p>

<p>"Oh no! If he is a real Windigo, it will only do him good by
driving out the ice. But if he <b><u>lies</u></b> to you, indeed, then
it certainly will injure him. But it will be good for him, and teach
him for the future not to impose upon people to frighten them."</p>

<p>However, they are, in general, kind and extremely indulgent to
those thus infected. They seem to consider it as an infliction and are
desirous of doing all they can to assist. There are, however, many
exceptions. But these again depend upon the circumstances attending
them. One of my best hunters here is thus tormented, or at least thus
torments himself, and very often desires his friends, in compassion,
to put a period to [his] existence the first symptoms he may shew of
cannibalism.</p>

<p>A young girl, lately married, and scarcely worth a <u>filip</u> so
small and diminutive, was this winter seized with this phrensy.  The
consequence was that the men durst not leave the tent for

<A NAME = "p50"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="50"></SPAN>
any length of time, being obliged to assist the women in holding and
preventing her from biting or eating any of the children and perhaps
herself. They bethought of a sacrifice: cropping her hair&mdash;and
short.</p>

<p>She recovered and is now well. She says, "I do not recollect any
single one circumstance of all that is told me. I thought I was always
on the tops of the trees." </p>

<p>There is another one of my Indians thus affected too.  The Indians
say it is a punishment (from some of their <u>familiars</u>, of
course) for so lightly esteeming their ceremonies&mdash;nay
indeed&mdash;and ridiculing them often.

"This fall," he began:</p>

<p class="quote">There were but two men of them together (with each
his family). Things bore a most dismal aspect.</p>

<p class="quote">At last the wife of the other, who, by-the-bye, is
said to [be] a little affected that way too, told him one day that he
sprang forward to seize one of <u>his</u> <u>own</u> children,
"Keep quiet for, thou dog, if a gun hath no effect on thee, my axe
shall. I shall chop thee up into slices! Thou hast then better be
quiet!"</p>

<p class="quote">This kept him indeed quiet for some time. How they
are now I cannot say, not having heard of them from the beginning of
December (now April 20th). </p>

<p>They appear most inclined to prey <u>first</u> upon their own
family. And they also think that firearms are absolutely unable to
injure them. <i>A ball cannot injure <u>Ice</u>. To
destroy <u>Ice</u>, it must be <u>chopped</u> <u>up</u>. And
the <u>heart</u> <u>then</u> <u>is</u> <u>all</u> <u>Ice</u>.</i></p>

<p>They sometimes, indeed frequently, recover with the warm weather,
<i>for the sun then <u>animates</u> all nature!!!</i></p>

<p>There are many other instances of a like kind in their tendency or
consequences, but different in their proceedings, that I cannot bring
to mind at present. I mention several of these to shew you the
different manner they are infected. In the mean time I shall relate
you others not less entertaining.</p>

<h4 class="section"><a name = "s18" href= "#tocs18">[Malignant Spirits]</a></h4>
<h5 class="section"><a name = "s18.1" href= "#tocs18.1">[North, Ice, Skeletons and the Crazy Woman]</a></h5>
<p>There are several spirits of whom these people are much afraid, but
four principally, they being the most malignant and little accepting
of <u>excuses</u>, however great and urgent they may be, for the non
performance of <u>their</u> sacrifices. These are the <u>North</u>,
<u>Ice</u>, <u>Skeletons</u> and the <u>Crazy</u> <u>Woman</u>, or
foolish, mad, jealous woman.</p>

<p class="quote">Not very many years ago an Indian had entered his
conjuring <u>hut</u>.  She came among the rest. But being displeased
with the conjurer on account of some sacrifice to other spirits, she
seized and carried him off! Skeleton perceived it, and being [fond] of
the conjurer, pursued Jealousy. Finding herself nearly overtaken, she
prefered her own safety to vengeance and let the <u>Indian</u>
fall <u>in</u> <u>some</u> <u>place</u> at a vast distance from where
he had been taken. Skeleton took him up and brought him back to the
great satisfaction of all parties.</p>

<p>She frequently comes with the <u>others</u> when they conjure. But
on her appearance she is desired to be quiet, "<u>Pay-ah-tick</u>":
gently, quietly, peaceably.</p>

<p> Master Skeleton also is as much dreaded as Folly, if not more,
because he shews himself at any time he pleases, it not being
necessary to conjure to call him to.</p>

<p>There <u>is</u> an Indian who, before he married, had his
<u>dress</u> <u>shoes</u> made by this lady (Folly, or Jealousy). She
was, of course, extremely fond of him. "The shoes were beautifully
garnished, far superior to anything of the kind done by <u>our</u>
women!" There are not

<A NAME = "p51"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="51"></SPAN>
wanting ladies, living with the white, who confer full share of their
<u>favors</u> on some of the Indians, and from one of these I fancy it
is he got these shoes. But to hide the business, [he] imputed them to
Folly, which served him a double end. If I can see that chap I shall
be very particular in my inquiries of him. I know him well.</p>

<p>This brings to my mind the <u>white</u> <u>stag</u> or hind
<u>Sertorius</u> had in his exile and during his wars with his
country, as mentioned by Plutarch. Indeed, to be candid,
<u><b>I</b></u> find a very great affinity between the ideas and
notions of these people and those of the Greeks and Romans. And by
these [affinities], much&mdash;far much&mdash;better than by the
incongruous hypothesis of the learned, might be traced
the <u>origin</u> of these people. And I am far from taking the task
to be difficult. Would <u>we</u> only divest ourselves
of <u>our</u> <u>own</u> prejudices and take the proper plan, this
great <u>Enigma</u>, if I may so explain myself, would be not
perfectly cleared I allow, but a rational clew [would be] afforded to
the unravelling of it. I have read many of these <u>hypotheses</u>,
but they are so filled with inconsistencies that I could scarcely
believe men could employ so much time in them. ..... I could say
something else instead of the conclusion of this last sentence. </p>

<p>A Gentleman, and an Englishman too, but I forget his name, would
wish to <u>insinuate</u> that these people are from a different origin
with ourselves: [from] Adam. And to prove his hypothesis, he begins by
an anatomizing hogs! (See the Encyclopaedia, not by Rees, but
<u>Fitz</u>-<u>Patrick</u> I believe.) This puts me in mind of some
of the <u>Newtonian</u> <u>Systems</u>: There is no such thing in
nature as <u>cold</u>. We must say <u>an</u> <u>absence</u>
of <u>heat</u>!  Why cannot we as well say there is no such thing as
<u>darkness</u>, but merely an <u>absence</u> <u>of</u> <u>light</u>,
or reverse either, and either will be as reasonable. Most strange
reasoning is this indeed!</p>

<h4><a name = "s19" href= "#tocs19">[Confession]</a></h4>
<p>These people have a notion that <u>confession</u> saves them from
many accidents and also preserves the lives of the sick, or rather
restores them to their wonted health. I have not learned the origin of
this&mdash;when, why, or wherefore&mdash;but it seems to be very
remote, to have [sprung up] with their mythology. I shall [make it] a
point to enquire very particularly into this, and for this, as well as
other things, at different quarters to find and
detect <u>errors</u>. But all, however, that I have written in these
pages, though there may be some difference in the recital and perhaps
a <u>few</u> straggling circumstances, are, I have great reason to
think, fundamentally the same throughout among these people. .....</p>

<p>When any one of them is particularly affected with diseases out of
the common course of nature <u>here</u>, or though the disease may be
precisely the same as all others, yet, from certain circumstances
individually, or a combination of them, they say he is Oh-gee-nay in
Cree, or On-gee-nay in Sauteux (the On pronounced as in French
and <u>not</u> English), by which it would seem as if they meant he
was afflicted or chastised for his own sins, or those of some of his
or her near relatives: father, mother, if children; if grown up and
married persons, for their own.  Whether they only imagine this, or
are informed of it by conjuring, <u>private</u>

<A NAME = "p52"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="52"></SPAN>
information from their <u>familiars</u>, or from the symptoms of the
sick person, I cannot say, but the thus afflicted person must confess
his sins publicly.</p>

<p>Now in these confessions, as in all their other discourses or
conversations (<u>initiating</u> and <u>giving
of</u> <u>medicines</u> <u>excepted</u>), they use no circumlocution,
no secret or enigmatical word or term, to screen themselves. But all
is delivered in plain terms and before everyone that chuses to hear.
These confessions are terrible things. And they seem far more sincere
and complete than those of many Catholics. They have wonderful,
retentive memories, and no scene, no crime from their earliest years
unto that day do they hide. But Great God! What abominations! One
would scarcely imagine the human mind capable of inventing such
infamously diabolical actions as <u>some</u> do commit: murder,
incest, and other things, if possible an hundredfold more, debasing the
human soul. Whether they repent of these things, neither can I say,
but it would appear as if they were the acts of a contrite and most
humbly penitant soul. I have never had an opportunity of hearing these
from <u>their</u> <u>own</u> mouths, but <u>other</u> Indians have
told me of them. And though before their
families <u>sometimes</u>, [they] have never omitted one single
circumstance, from the suggestions of the idea, down to the very last
<u>conclusion</u>.</p>

<p>When I heard of these things at first, I <u>would</u> <u>not</u>
believe them.  But hearing them come so
circumstantially, <u>I</u> <u>trembled
for</u> <u>the</u> <u>Land</u> <u>I sojourned in</u> <i>lest it should
vomit me out as the land of Canaan did its inhabitants</i>,<i> or be
swallowed up in its destruction as Sodom and Gomorrah!</i> </p>

<p>It is true they are not <u>all</u> so. No, I am told there are but
few, and in charity I hope it is [so]. Otherwise what will be my fate
seeing I am, in a certain degree, partaker with them? Surely the
inhabitants of such a land, at <u>best</u>, cannot look for more than
mere <u>present</u> <u>enjoyment</u>. When I reflect seriously
on <u>all</u> these things, as I sometimes do, revolving them in every
different manner in my mind, it is beyond the power of words to
express my feelings. Poor unfortunate, blind creatures! That it is
from <u>blindness</u> they commit these things, I am fully persuaded,
because I am equally confident that they do not attach that same
degree of criminality to them we, <u>from</u> <u>the</u>
<u>revealing</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Scriptures</u> to us,
do. Some they consider in the light of trifles, some natural, some
weaknesses. But all tend to the gratification of most bestial
appetites whatever may have been the original cause, <u>curiosity</u>
or otherwise.</p>

<p>However, I received a piece of information in one of these,
and <u>it</u> was circumstantially detailed, that has cleared a point
to me I could never solve. And though I enquired of both Wool and Bob,
they were not wiser than myself. Indeed, without the <u>trial</u> or
experiment, it seems impossible to say certainly where the cause
lies. Now I know it. If ever an opportunity offers, or that it pleases
God I again revisit my own lands, I shall be able to speak to a
certainty. As I cannot write Latin, I shall say no more of <u>it</u>
at present.</p>

<p>A few years back an Indian at the next post above this died. He had
been a long time sick,

<A NAME = "p53"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="53"></SPAN>
and from this conceived himself <u>ongenay</u> and accordingly
prepared for his confession.  Having received the details at second
and third hand, I shall endeavour to give <u>part</u> of them to you
as near <u>their</u> stile as I can. But really I find
myself <u>very</u> <u>inadequate</u> to the task. There is a certain
<u>poetic</u> sublimity in their language on such <u>like</u>
occasions as will not easily meet with credit from those (the better
informed) of the civilized world unacquainted with these people. Even
amongst ourselves there are but few, for few can judge of the beauties
of a language, and most of those few have too high a notion of their
own mighty superiority to stoop to <u>regular</u> conversation with
them.</p>

<p>But to return&mdash;After having revealed all, or most part, of his
sins to the company in general, he thus addressed his family in
particular:</p>

<p class="quote"> You see, my children, my distressed state. I cannot
move nor stir without assistance. And I feel strengthened in my lungs
(breast, heart), merely as it were by permission of my <u>Dreamed</u>,
(some particular one he meant) to divulge my offenses to the gods (or
God) publicly, before you all, to deter you from the same vices
(wickednesses).</p>

<p class="quote">I was once a young man also, the same as you are now,
healthy and vigorous. Nothing appeared difficult nor dangerous to
me. I lived as became a man, and prospered accordingly. But I thought
that this proceeded from my own power only. Had I so continued, all
had been well! But no, I <u>unfortunately</u> heard speak of such
Indians (meaning <u>this</u>
place, <u>as</u> <u>my</u> <u>informants</u>
<u>tell</u> <u>me</u>), how powerful they were in their medicines, the
extraordinary feats they performed. I envied them, and thought that I
required but <u>that</u> knowledge more to render me perfect
(immortal) and happy. I undertook a voyage to that place. I found that
the bare truth had been scarcely told me. I burned with anxiety to
become as knowing as themselves, and I was gratified.</p>

<p class="quote">Had I rested here, all had yet been well. But in
learning their medicines, I also learned of them those vices, those
sins, that by <u>their</u> <u>practice</u> have reduced me to this
wretched situation.</p>

<p class = "quote"> My sons!  Take example from your father!  Be good,
charitable, and peaceable Indians as I was at the first set off of my
life. And employ the same means; indulge, use, the same anxiety
to <u>avoid</u>, that I did to <u>procure</u> that information that
hath reduced me so far below the level even of a dog. Never forget
this. Never indulge even the least desire of such acquisitions.  For
if you once begin, you will be deluded by their flattery to that
destruction I have found. But you are young men! And unless you find
grace, you also will be deluded and lost as I am!</p>

<p> I have heard a good deal said of <u>this</u> Indian's confession and
exhortations to his sons. They were not lost. He himself lived but a
short time and seemed much comforted by it. </p>

<h4 class="section"><a name = "s20" href= "#tocs20">[Animal Sacrifice (Beaver Indians)]</a></h4>
<p>There is a tribe of <u>Athabasca</u> that go by the name
of <u>Beaver</u> <u>Indians</u>. From the tenets of their religion,
I <u>am</u> <u>told</u> that, when laying under any malediction,
bewichisms, or conceive themselves so, they make a vow that the first
animal they shall kill they will do <u>so</u>. They do not fail, but
immediately proceed in quest of another which, by this diabolical
action, they think they will soon find and kill. They do
not <u>touch</u> the animal afterwards,

<A NAME = "p54"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="54"></SPAN>
as those beasts among the Crees and Sauteux do, but leave it lay as a
sacrifice. They consider it as a duty imposed upon them. But the
others do it from mere beastiality. "Such a one did so&mdash;brought
home part of the meat, and we all of us eat it! Oh! the dog!" said an
Indian not long ago to me.</p>

<h4 class="section"><a name = "s21" href= "#tocs21">[Fragments]</a></h4>
<p>Lest I may not soon have another opportunity of writing on these
subjects to <u>you</u>, I shall add a few more <u>fragments</u>.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s21.1" href= "#tocs21.1">[The Great Doctor]</a></h5>
<p class="quote">An Indian here, passing for a great doctor, was
applied to (and is still) by many to attend upon them. </p>

<p class="quote">Several of these he retrieved from death. One of his
dreamed, I believe the North, was not pleased and told the doctor
never to administer his medicines to those he had doomed to death.
The doctor replied it was hard and uncharitable seeing he could
prolong their days a little. </p>

<p class="quote">"Well! For every one that thou dost deprive me of, I
shall take one of thy children." And the doctor lost eight or nine. (I
cannot now remember well). But he is now grown more cautious.</p>

<p class="quote">But this Doctor is himself a beast.</p>

<p class="quote"> Being unable to stand from sickness, he told two of
his wives, "Take ye me one under each arm to my [sweet-heart]. I feel
myself dying and don't chuse <u>thus</u> to go."  And he actually
did. Remember I <u>am</u> <u>told</u> <u>this</u>, but I have reasons
to believe it.</p>

<p>He is an incestuous beast. Otherwise, I find him a good Indian and,
what is most strange, sensible beyond many of his equals.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name = "s21.2" href= "#tocs21.2">[The Devil and the Tailor Caricature]</a></h5>
<p>I have got a caricature here of the Devil carrying off a tailor. I
asked one of my Indians if any of their familiars resembled him and
how they were. The reply was:</p>

<p class="quote"> Yes, he resides in the North (at the Pole I suppose)
and has a vast number of young men. The Indians report of some finding
their tracks that are very numerous and exactly resemble the tracks of
the grey deer (carriboeuf). But neither [he] nor his young men are very
wicked. North, Ice, Skeleton and Folly are the most wicked and ill
inclined of all those we dream of or enter the conjuring box!</p>

<h4 class="section"><a name = "s22" href= "#tocs22">[Feasts]</a></h4>
<p>Of their feasts I cannot say more than any common observer. I have
been invited and partaken of many of them, but I never thought of
enquiring into their origin [and] the causes of them. But from the
little I could learn, or rather understand from the speeches made
at <u>all</u> of them, and what I have learnt in regard to other
things, I think [I] may say, without dreading contradiction, that as
there are songs [and] ceremonies appropriate to every one of their
gods or familiars or devils, there [are] also <u>feasts</u> made for
each according to the whim, dream or some other circumstance of the
one who makes them.</p>

<p>We denominate these 'feasts', and from their own term it would
seem they so mean. But I consider this again as a premature
interpretation which I have not leisure to explain. I consider them
rather as <u>sacrifices</u>. Indeed they may perhaps rather be
esteemed as partaking of both. I have somewhere above said that they
are <u>obliged</u> to make an annual sacrifice to some of their gods
as the non-performance passes not off with impunity. These therefore
are obligatory or compulsory sacrifices. But besides these they also
have free-will sacrifices.</p>

<p>These feasts or sacrifices are not <u>universally</u>

<A NAME = "p55"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="55"></SPAN>
of <u>flesh</u>. They have them of flesh, grease, dried berries [and]
rum. And few of these feasts are made
without <u>the</u> <u>one</u> <u>who</u> <u>makes</u> <u>it</u> [offering]
a certain [part] (very small, only a few mouthsful) to <u>him</u> whom
it is in honor of or intended for. [This] he most commonly puts into
the fire, <u>in</u> or on the ground. Some of them are very grand and
ceremonius, the <u>titbits</u> of the animal only, as the head,
heart, and liver, tongue, and paws when of a bear.</p>

<p>It is only the great men that are allowed to eat of these. Others
again, besides the above, [eat] the brisket, rump and ribbs. And very
seldom a woman is allowed to partake of them, particularly if it
is <u>un</u> <u>festin</u> <u>à</u> <u>tout</u> <u>manger</u>&mdash;to
eat the whole. </p>

<p>Though there may be sufficient for two or three times the number of
guests, all must be eaten before day. Though, in certain cases, the
feaster is obliged, and commonly does, take part back, providing a
knife, a bit of tobacco, or something else attend with the dish.</p>

<p>In these great feasts, the feaster makes one or several speeches
before <u>we</u> begin to eat, and one again after all is done. And
[he] sometimes sings, beats the drum and [makes] speeches during the
whole time of the feast, never partaking of a morsel himself. At some
of them there is dancing to be performed.</p>

<p> I happened to be called to one of these many years ago. It was the
principal parts of a bear. And the paunch had been filled with the
liver, heart and fat, with blood, minced, and much resembling that
dish the Scotch term <u>haggish</u>. We were all very hungry, and
though we gormandized (it cannot be called <u>eating</u>) there yet
remained full two thirds. The Feaster was uneasy, and said he would
have been proud had we eaten all, for in that case his dreamed would
have been propitious. We were obliged to dance also. But when I could
stow no more, I gave him my knife and a bit of tobacco and walked off
leaving him to settle with his god as well as he could. But indeed I
was not very scrupulous then, otherwise I had most certainly avoided
many of them though it is oftentimes dangerous if there be not method
or qualification in the refusal.</p>

<p>Their feasts of rum are often to some one of the four wicked ones,
praying them to be propitious and not allow themselves to be
influenced by the wicked solicitations of envious Indians.</p>

<p>Many years ago I happened to be out a hunting a few miles from the
house and came unexpectedly upon the lodge of a few Indians I had that
day given rum to. I heard one of them harangue, and drew up cautiously
to listen. He entreated the rain, snow and frost to have pity upon
their young ones (that they might kill).</p>

<p>I communicated this a few years after to a couple of gentlemen. One
of them, longer in the country than myself, denied it and enquired of
his wife who had lived a long time with the Indians. She corroborated
his denial. I perceived the cause, and told him that it was
because <u>they</u> do not chuse that we become too well informed of
all their ceremonies. It was to no effect, and I had almost a mind to
credit the woman too myself, but by <u>insinuation</u> I find I am
perfectly right.</p>

<p>Thus

<A NAME = "p56"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="56"></SPAN>
it happens in almost everything else. A thing that does not meet with
our approbation, or be a little beyond the sphere of our limited
information, we immediately deny or condemn. Whereas by
taking <b><u>proper</u></b> measures to enquire or inform ourselves,
not only those things themselves, but others far more interesting, and
sometimes too of the greatest moment, whether to ourselves or others,
are rendered probable, reasonable, certain.</p>

<p>Hence it is also that many, upon receiving a piece of information,
there rest themselves as upon a rock of certainty. Now either of these
I consider equally blameable as they lead to distrust, doubt, and
sometimes to a complete refutation or assertion of facts that very
oftentimes cast a stain or stigma, sometimes upon the whole people,
and without any other foundation than, as might be said, that all
powerful <u>veto</u>.</p>

<p>They have feasts for the dead, most commonly berries, or in
countries where it is made, sugar. Generally yearly a bark box of
perhaps 2 or 3 gallons is placed <u>in</u> the grave, upon it, or well
hid in some private nook, if they are afraid, or do not chuse, it be
taken.</p>

<p>I ought rather to have said these are sacrifices. But independent
of these, they have feasts also, and feasts of baptism&mdash;feasts in
short for almost every occasion. Besides these they
have <u>smoking</u> feasts; these are to deliberate. I shall, should
it please God I live, make it a point to enquire particularly into the
origin of all these.</p>

<h4 class="section"><a name = "s23" href= "#tocs23">[Conjuring Ceremony
(June 4th, 1823)]</a></h4>
<p>June 5th. These last 3 days have been busy and turbulent ones for
me. It is now considerably past midnight (and of course the 6th June)
but my Indians are drinking and I cannot think of going to bed.  Till
they do I shall employ my few remaining <u>leisure</u> moments ('till
next year, please God I live so long) in giving you an account of a
conjuring bout I, with some difficulty, got an Indian to make last
night (June 4<u>th</u>).</p>

<p>In the evening the hut was prepared at some distance from the
houses on account of the stink, as <u>the spirits</u> cannot or will
not endure any pollution. The hut consisted of ten poles about seven
feet out of ground, well stuck in, and somewhat better than three feet
diameter. The Poles were secured with two hoops. They were covered
with two parchment skins (of moose) well bound with many rounds of
strong leather line. <u>The</u> <u>top</u> <u>was</u>
<u><b>covered</b></u> with a dressed skin and secured also, to prevent
its being carried off (by the wind).</p>

<p>About 10 P.M. (still broad daylight with us) we drew up with the
conjurer, smoked and chatted some time. After this he took his drum,
much resembling a tambourine, and with a stick gently struck it all
the time he made a speech. I was almost touching him (all seated) but
from the noise of the drum and his low voice, for the man has a
dreadful complaint on his lungs, I could only gather, "Take pity upon
me; take pity upon me. Hear and come. Let me not speak in vain, nor
become abashed. Show me charity. ..."  It was a moderate and decent
prayer. After this <u>they</u>, for there were several men,

<A NAME = "p57"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="57"></SPAN>
began to sing using the drum and rattler. They sang, among others, the
Moose, Horse, Bear, and Dog songs, about a dozen in number.</p>

<p>[Then] he prepared by taking off his clothes, all to his cloute, and
asked who should tie him. I replied that I would, but was afraid
of hurting him. Another conjurer did, beginning with his fingers
between the 2 joints nearest the hand, nearly as I can describe it,
thus giving a double turn to the line between each finger. And the
line was new mackerel, small, which I happened to have in my pocket by
accident. I drew up to <u>inspect</u>. And observing the fingers to
swell upon his complaining of the tightness, I felt a good deal for
him.</p>

<p>After this his blanket was wrapped round him and tied in such a
manner, lengthways, crossways and every way. And a good knot <u>I</u>
tied at each meeting of the cords, for I assisted in <u>this</u>, that
I could have laid any wager that it was beyond the power of spirits
themselves, thus tied, to [extricate] themselves.  And his hands
were <u>under</u> his hams. As he could no more move than fly, <u>of
himself</u>, the other conjurer and I put him to the door.  But behold
it was with difficulty! We could just get his head in, the entry being
too narrow by about ten or twelve inches screwing and jaming
considered.</p>

<p>"It will do, it will do." said the conjurer, "Cover me now."</p>

<p>His back was covered with a blanket, and we all retreated to our
seats, myself about four feet distant. The others took the drum and
began to sing.</p>

<p>I could not help but laughing in myself and pitying the boldness of
their vanity. But I had soon occasion to think otherwise, and had I
not predetermined that reason should conduct me throughout the whole
of this, I cannot say how far in the <u>other</u> extreme <u>I</u>
might have gone.</p>

<p>But to return: The conjurer desired the others to sing.  They
began a short song, I believe it was that of the <u>Stone</u>, and the
man entered in an instant! I was struck dumb with astonishment, for he
appeared to me to <u>slide</u> in by something that was neither
invisible nor descernible. I heard something that, for the life of me,
I cannot account for, and that's all. </p>

<p>From the time we covered him (twenty-five minutes past 10 P.M.) to
the time we had done hunting for the twine that tied his fingers, not
quite five minutes elapsed. And not one and a half minutes [passed]
before his blanket and the cords were thrown out to us! Not one of
them, apparently (one knot) <u>untied</u>! My astonishment and
apprehensions of his being entirely carried off from us were such that
I was nearly springing up to haul him out for fear of his being
forever lost.</p>

<p>The others continued singing a few other songs, and I had the
utmost anxiety in hearing [him] repeatedly call out, as if in the
greatest apprehensions himself, "Enough! Enough!

<A NAME = "p58"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="58"></SPAN>
<b>Enough</b> of ye I say!", and frequently for the space of some
minutes repeating the same, and now and then calling out, "Do
not <u>Thou</u> enter!" </p>

<p>The <u>Stone</u> was the first one known to us by his song; for
every one, almost, that entered sang <u>his</u> song, to which those
(the Indians) on the outside would keep chorus. A vast number entered.
I verily believe upward of an hundred [did so], for upwards of that
number of times the frame shook back and forwards, and very smartly,
as if to fall. And among the first were some truly terrible
characters.  I have almost entirely converted myself from these
foolish ideas of ghosts and hobgoblins, but I assure you in truth that
I more than once felt very uneasy.</p>

<p>The Ice entered. He made a noise extremely resembling that made by
a person shivering with cold, loud, and hoarse and <u>liquid</u>.</p>

<p>The Devil <u>himself</u> also entered
in <u>propria</u> <u>persona</u>, in a very authoritative and
commanding manner. I assure you there was no laughing nor gigling
outside. All the time he sang and spoke.</p>

<p>The Turtle spoke as an old, jocular man. "I hate the French, for in
their travels, when they find me, they kill me and eat me. I shall
answer none of their questions." But this was a joke, for he
laughed.</p>

<p>"Speak out, Turtle! Speak out louder that we hear thee!"  said
those without.</p>

<p>"I would too," replied he, "but my voice is so strong I must
contract it thus, otherwise ye could not endure the sound of
it. Stop!" continued he, "I must imitate the drunk!" which he did to
the great diversion of us all. And [he] concluded with snoring, the
natural end of all drunken feasts, and then became quiet.</p>

<p>On which another voice (which I also perfectly heard and understood
as well [as] the Turtle herself [sic]) cried out, "See! See if she
does not look like a frog stretched out!" and this raised a proper
laugh both in and out.</p>

<p>The Dog entered, and spoke perfectly plain and [distinctly],
and with a more elegant and harmonious voice [than] I ever heard in my
life.</p>

<p>Bears of three or four different sorts, the Horse, Moose,
Skeletons, spirits of departed
and <u>still</u> <u>living</u> <u>friends</u> entered. But none but
the latter and above mentioned were to be understood by any but the
conjurer himself. </p>

<p>On the entering of one, "That is my (<u>adopted</u>) Son." said an
Indian seated by me, and called out his name to which he readily
answered besides questions. This young man and a girl, both living,
spoke very plain[ly] (you must observe that it is not their bodies,
but their souls or spirits that enter). [There were] children almost
at the instant of birth, dwarfs, giants. But this latter did make a
noise indeed.</p>

<p>We all laughed very heartily when the Horse entered, for it appears
he passed too near the Turtle who called out as the horse was flying
about (in the inside) singing and rattling his rattler, "I wish you
would take care of yourself and <u>not</u>

<A NAME = "p59"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="59"></SPAN>
<u>tread</u> on one." in allusion to his diminutive size in comparison
with that of Horse.</p>

<p>It is somewhat surprising that everyone that entered, whether he
spoke [plainly], or was interpreted, their first words were, "Your lands
are distressed. Keep not on the Grand River&mdash;sickness,
sickness."</p>

<p>"But from amongst <u>ye</u> <u>here</u> I shall select only a few
aged ones." said one of the latter, but in a <u>voice</u> no one but
the conjurer could understand.</p>

<p>As he went out, however, the conjurer paid him a most bawdy
compliment. We all laughed and asked what was the matter. </p>

<p>"Pah! Nothing. I am only afraid of him." said the conjurer</p>

<p>One of them that entered, apparantly the Devil himself for he spoke
and acted <u>en</u> <u>veritable</u> <u>maitre</u>, startled us all a
great deal and enquired authoritatively and angrily, "What want ye of
me? Speak!"</p>

<p>Upon several hurried enquiries put to him, he said that some things
I saw and heard in my house this winter were by Mr. Frobisher, who
expired so dreadfully in 1819. "He is a skeleton (Pah-kack); and it is
he who built <u>this</u> house. He comes to see."</p>

<p>Though I did certainly both hear and see several times this
winter, and once in particular about two A.M., yet I do not feel much
inclined to add faith to this assertion of Davy's. I must have
something more substantial.  But I am much inclined to doubt master
Davy's assertions and consider <u>this</u> and several others of his
sayings at former periods in the same light as those he delivered at
many of [the] Grecian temples, for I have every substantial reason to
consider him as the same identical gentleman.  However, a short time
hence will decide.
</p>

<p>The Turtle said we should have a good deal of rain, but not
a <u>very</u> <u>great</u> <u>deal</u>, and a very high wind, and as
soon as the Sun should appear. "At its setting, an Indian (naming him
by a very extraordinary and bawdy feature in his <u>person</u>) should
arrive and bring us meat; <u>but</u> <u>this</u>
<u>you</u> <u>will</u> <u>eat</u> <u>of</u> <u>course</u>, <u>and</u> <u>I
shall go</u> <u>without</u>."</p>

<p>{"Beware of yourselves. Tomorrow night you shall drink and be
drunk. Drink and leave the house as soon as you
can, <u>for</u> <u><b>there</b></u> <u><b>are</b></u> <u>from</u> <u>that</u>
<u>wind</u> (by which he designated the <u>South</u>) <u>who</u> <u>if</u>
<u>they</u> <u>drink</u> <u>with</u> <u>ye</u>, <u>ye</u> <u>shall</u>
<u>become</u> <u>pitiful</u>" alluding to two blackguard half breed
brothers who, proud of the bravery of their deceased father, are ever
and anon insulting and domineering over other Indians. It is worthy of
remark that an aged man in the course of this last winter was
[advised] of the same and repeatedly pressed not to drink at the house
on their accord}. </p>

<p>This is now the 6th (June). The Sun appears, but the wind is very
high, and we have frequent showers of rain and snow. About midnight
the conjurer addressed me and asked if I wished to see any
of <u>them</u> (the Spirits). I accepted the offer and thrust my head
underneath. And being upon my back, I looked up and near the top
observed a light as of a star in a cloudy night, about one and a half
inches long and one broad&mdash;

<A NAME = "p60"></A>
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum" title="60"></SPAN>
though dim, yet perfectly
distinct. Though <u>they</u> <u><b>all</b></u> appear as lights, some
larger and others smaller, this one was denominated the Fisher Star,
the name by which they designate the Plough, I believe we call it, or
Great Bear, from the supposed resemblance it bears to that animal, the
fisher.</p>

<p>When I was entering, several of the Indians on the outside called
out to the spirits, "Gently! Gently! It is our Chief who wishes to see
you. Do him no evil!"  I had my apprehensions. </p>

<p>A little after one P.M. one of my men looked in with several
Indians and saw several small lights about as large as the
thumbnail. A few minutes before two P.M., being daylight, they gave
another shaking to the frame and made their exit.</p>

<p>The above is an account of only a small part, for I am too much
pressed for time. I cannot therefore enter into particulars, nor a
larger detail, nor give you my opinion further than a few words. I am
fully convinced, as much so as that I am in existence, that spirits of
some kind did really and virtually enter, some truly terrific, but
others, again, quite of a different character.</p>

<p>I cannot enter into a detail by comparisons from ancient and more
modern history, but I found the consonance, analogy, resemblance,
affinity, or whatever it may be termed, so great, so conspicuous that
I verily believe I shall never forget the impressions of that
evening.</p>

<p>But above all things that stick most forcibly in my mind is the
unbound gratitude we owe and ought to shew every instant of our
existence to that Almighty Power that deigned to sacrifice his only
Son for us for our Salvation! Oh my God, let me never forget this!
And teach me to thank thee not only with my lips but with every action
of my life!</p>

<p>Here I must close and in a few minutes seal up this for your
perusal, sincerely wishing I may find an opportunity, safe, of
conveying it to you.</p>

<p>How earnestly I wish Robert had been present and understood the
language. This would convince the most skeptic.</p>

The following few Stories or Tales will give a better notion or Idea of the religion of these
People than every other description  <u><b>I</b></u> am able to pen, &amp; as their <u>history</u> is read with interest, I am
persuaded these few Pages will be found equally deserving attention.  I give them the same as I
received them &amp; leave every one to make his own remarks &amp; to draw his own conclusions.

My Interpretor, a young half breed, passed the winter of -'19-'20 with the Indians &amp;
gives this account.  One day shortly before Christmass he was out with an
elderly man, a chief of this place, a hunting.  Suddenly he stopped as to <u>listen</u>, apparent-
ly with great eagerness &amp; anxiety, upon which after allowing a sufficient time the
Int. asked what was the matter? "Listen &amp; you'll hear" "I have listened, says the Intr. but hear no-
"thing &amp; it is surprising that you who are deaf should hear &amp; I not"&mdash;"Ah! a white man is thy
"father &amp; thou are just as <u>skeptical</u>: doubting &amp; ridiculing every thing we say or do 'till
"when it is then too late&mdash;then ye lament, but in vain ...." After this the Indian became much
down-cast &amp; very thoughtful for several days; &amp; as if to increase his anxiety or rather to to corroborate
the husbands assertions, his wife said that one day she also <u>heard</u>, tho' the other women that were
with her heard nothing, &amp; an altercation ensued.  His uneasyness increasing too much he was
forced to have recourse to <u>their</u> only alternative in such cases, i.e. <u>une Jonglerie</u> as the french
term it, that is conjuring. One of their party, another half-breed, abandoned many years since
by his Father &amp; leading an  indian life, was applied to: he is reputed a <u>true</u> <u>man</u>, i.e. never lies.
Out of respect to the other he was induced to consent, but much against his will; "for I am
"much afraid that some of these <u>times</u> <u>they</u> <u>will</u> <u>carry</u> <u>me</u> <u>off</u>." He was prepared, &amp; entered with
his <u>rattler</u>, shortly after which the box &amp; the <u>rattler</u> began to move in the usual brisk &amp;
violent manner. <u>Many</u> entered, &amp; one asked "what was wanted that they had been called
"upon." The indian from the outside of the frame (for only the conjuror alone &amp;
enters) inquired "if there was not some evil spirit near from whom he had much
"every thing to dread?" &mdash;"No, replied the same voice, <u>all is quiet</u>, you trouble yourself
"with vain phantoms" "What then is the meaning, asked again the Indian, of the those sud-
"den flashes of light I sometimes see in the night?"&mdash;"What! rejoined another voice from within,
"hast thou attained unto this age &amp; never yet observed this;" &amp; then laughing, continued,  "it is al-
"ways the case during this <u>moon</u> (December) &amp; if you doubt me, for the future observe
"attentively &amp; you will find it to be the case".&mdash;This satisfied him for the time, he became
cheerful &amp; assumed his wonted ways.  But not for a long time&mdash;he soon relapsed, &amp; after
some days applied again to the conjurer. When he had entered his box or frame&mdash;a
number again entered &amp; one of them enquired why they were called for? The conjuror
said-. "What? says he,* "again! Thou art very skeptical&mdash;dost thou not believe? now
thou art fond of, thou wantest to be haunted, well thou shalt have thy desire." At these

these dreadful words, which were uttered in an angry &amp; reproving manner, every soul was struck
with terror; but as if to give some consolation assured him "that that spirit had but just
left his <u>home</u>, &amp; coming on very slowly would not be up with them 'till <u>such a time</u>,
a little prior to which they were ordered to conjure again, when they would be told what to
do. This was no pleasant information to the conjuror who never undertook this job
but with the greatest reluctance, nay indeed even sometimes horor: However, he neither, poor creature had no alternative. At the
time appointed he entered again, every thing being prepared. After the preliminary de-
mands or questions &amp;c. "yes replies one of the <u>spirits</u>, that which thou dreadest <u>is</u> near, &amp;
"is drawing on apace" ... "How shall we do? what shall we do?" exclaimed the indian&mdash;
At last one of them, who goes by the name of the Bull or Buffaloe (thru the conjuror, for he
alone could understand him his voice being hoarse &amp; rough, his uttering thick &amp; inarticulate)
"asked the indian if he remembered  of a dream he made whilst yet a young man?." "Yes"
"replies the indian&mdash;I remember perfectly,&mdash;I dreamed I saw one just like yourself,
"who told me that when advanced in life I should be much troubled one winter, but
"by a certain sacrifice &amp; a sweating <b><u>bout</u></b> I should be releived; but I have not the means
"here,&mdash;I have no stones"&mdash;"you are encamped upon them rejoined the <u>spirit</u> &amp; at the
"door of your tent are some" "yes, but says the indian the dogs have <u>watered</u> them,
"&amp; they are otherwise soiled"&mdash;"Fool, put them in the fire, will not the fire heat,
"&amp; make them change color, &amp; purify them? Do this, fail not &amp; be not uneasy&mdash;
"we shall go four of us (spirits) &amp; amuse him upon the road, &amp; endeavour to
"drive him back." At this the Interpretor burst out laughing &amp; exclaimed "sacré bande de
Betes &amp; do you beleive all that d__d nonsense?" "You doubt too says a voice addres-
"sing him (the In.) from the inside; go out of the tent &amp; listen, you'll see if <u><b>we</b></u>
"<b>lie</b>"&mdash;he did indeed go out to some distance &amp; after awhile heard as a distant
hollow noise, which increased 'till it became considerably more distinct &amp; then
vanished as a great gust of wind, tho' the night was mild, calm, clear &amp; beauti-
fully serene&mdash;it even startled the dogs. "<b><u>Mahn</u></b>! (an indian term or exclamation signifying haste)
"said the spirits from within, <u>they</u> have turned him off the road, as soon as the noise was
"heard, but he will not turn back, or go home: he is <u>sent</u> after you by another indian
'who conjured him up from out the Deep (i.e the bottom of some flood) but be not
"too uneasy, if these four will not do, there are yet a vast many of us, so that between
"us all we <u>shall</u> drive him back: we will perplex &amp; bewilder him: surround, tor-
"ment &amp; tease him on every side: but he is of a monstrous size,  ferocious &amp; withal
"enraged against you:&mdash;The task is mighty difficult. <u>Observe</u>! See how beautifully
"serene the night is&mdash;if we succeed, the sky will change all of a sudden, &amp; there

"This will happen between day light &amp; Sun rise, <u>&amp;</u> <u>is</u> <u>his</u> <u>spirit</u>, all that will remain
in his power&mdash;he'll then return to his home."&mdash;The Int<u>r</u>, tho he laughed at all this,
&amp; could not bring himself to credit it, yet swears that he  heard the rumbling noise, <u>on</u>
<u>their</u> <u>road</u>, &amp; seemingly far off: the indians gave implicit faith to all&mdash;&amp; the conjuror
did not know what to beleive "there is something says he, for <u>my Dreamed</u>, or <u>Dreamers</u>
"have assured me of it, but <b><u>I</u></b>  dont know what to say&mdash;however, most assuredly tomor-
"row morning we shall have the snow." <u>This</u> <u>snow</u> both comforted &amp; depressed the poor
indian very much, seeing the weather was then so beautiful &amp; so destitute of
all the usual signs of bad weather. It did snow&mdash;it came as foretold, quite sudden-
ly, &amp; as suddenly became fine again. In the ensuing morning the Indian begged of the Inter-
preter to chuse one of the longest &amp; straightest Pine (Epinette) trees he could find of the thickness
of his thigh; to peel off all the bark nicely, leaving but a small tuft of the branches at the
tip end&mdash;this they painted cross-ways with bars of vermillion &amp; charcoal, alternately
the whole length, leaving however some intervals undaubded&mdash;
&amp; about 5 or 6 feet from the Ground, fastened a Pair of artificial horns, representing those
of a Bull, &amp; decorated with ribbon. He also (the Indian I mean) made the sweat-
ing hut, &amp; in short done every thing as directed, after which he (the indian) became to
resume his wonted cheerfulness &amp; contentment. However, once more he was obliged
to have recourse again to the Conjuror, from hearing another rumbling noise; "Thou
"Fool answered the spirits: wilt thou never have done tormenting thyself &amp; dis-
"quieting us&mdash;that rumbling noise proceeds from the ice in a Lake a long way
"off&mdash;it is only the ice&mdash;be therefore peaceable&mdash;I shall advertise thee if any
"ill is to happen thee."&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The Flashes of light, or those sudden glares that
the indian inquired of the spirits, is, as the told him, lightning, which always happens in
the month of December &amp; they laughed at his having lived so long without observing it
before. The Conjuror had lost his smoking bag one day that he was out a hunting &amp;
as it contained his only steel &amp; not a small part of his winter stock of Tobacco &amp;c. he
was very uneasy, &amp; hunted several times for it: They having told the Interpretor often
how kind &amp; charitable &amp; indulgent those <u>spirits of the upper regions</u> were, &amp; he,
desirous of Proving them, told the Conjuror to send for his bag. He asked "which of
"ye will go for my bag that I lost? He that brings it me, I shall make him
"smoke" "I will go, said one&mdash;they heard a fluttering noise, &amp; soon after they heard the
same fluttering noise &amp; the rattler move, &amp; down fell the bag by the conjuror, covered with snow&mdash;
"How stupid thou art, said the spirit, naming the Conjuror, thou passedst over it &amp; yet
"did not see it." It was a long time since the bag was lost &amp; the distance was several miles.&mdash;
Another one, could not kill with his Gun, owing to its being crooked, or some other cause&mdash;

&mdash;however, he attached the fault to the Gun&mdash;The first time, I beleive it was, that this
half-breed conjured.  The People on the outside hearing many voices speak as they entered,
at last they stopped at one whose voice &amp; articulation was different from that of the others: "Who
"is that one just now entered? said those outside&mdash;"It is the <u>Sun</u>, replied the Conjuror"
"ha! well, I am happy of it, said the the indian, is it not <u>he</u> who says himself able
"to repair Fire-arms (Guns), &amp; do anything with them he pleases?&mdash;ask him (ad-
"dressing the Conjuror) if he will not have compassion on me &amp; put my Gun to rights, that
"I also may kill&mdash;I am walking every day &amp; frequently shoot at moose, but always miss"--
"Hand it me" said a voice from the top of the conjuring frame. The Gun was given to
the Conjuror.  "It is loaded, continued the voice, shall I fire it off?"&mdash;"You may, but
"take care you hurt no body" replied the indian. The Gun was fired, &amp; shortly after
handed back to the owner&mdash;"Here is your Gun&mdash;you will kill with it now" said the
Spirit.&mdash;&mdash;Both this business of the Gun &amp; smoking bag took place, the
first time, I beleive, the man Conjured.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    There are but few Individuals (i.e. men) among the
Sauteux or Cris, or Crees who have not their medicine bags&mdash;&amp; initiated into some cere-
mony or other, but it is  not <u>all</u> of them who can Conjur. Among some tribes, most
of them, can; &amp; among others again, there are but very few.  Nor is it every one of them
that tells <u>all truth</u>, some scarcily nothing but lies, others again <b>not one</b> false-
hood, &amp; this depends upon their <b><u>Dreamed</u></b>, sometimes, but I think may be equally
imputed to their own selves, i.e. Presumption, ignorance, folly, or any other of our
passions or weaknesses. But to become Conjurors, they have rights &amp; ceremonies
to Perform &amp; go through, which, tho' apparently simple &amp; absurd, yet I have no doubt but
fully answer their ends. Any person among them wishing to <u>dive</u> into futurity,
must be Young &amp; unpolluted. At any age between 18 &amp; 25. Tho' as near as I can
learn between 17 &amp; 20 years old&mdash;they must have had no intercourse with
the other Sex&mdash;they must be chaste &amp; unpolluted. In the spring of the year they
chuse a proper place at a sufficient distance from the camp not be discovered
nor disturbed. They make themselves a bed of Grass, or hay as we term it, &amp;
have besides enough to make them a covering. When all this is done&mdash;&amp; they do it entirely
alone, they strip stark naked &amp; put all their things <b><u>a good way off</u></b> &amp; then return,
ly on this bed &amp; then cover themselves with the rest of the Grass.  Here they remain &amp;
endeavour to <u>sleep</u>, which from their nature is no very difficult task.  But, du-
ring whatever time they may remain, they must neither eat nor drink. If they want to
Dream of the Spirits above, their bed must be made at some distance from the Ground
&mdash;if of Spirits inhabiting our Earth, or those residing in the waters, on the Ground.

on the Ground. Here they ly for a longer or shorter time,  according to their success, or the
orders of the Dreamed. Some remain but 3 or 4 days, some 10, &amp; I have be told one re-
mained 30 days without eating or drinking; such was the delight he received from his
Dreams!&mdash;When I laughed at this, the man was vexed, &amp; the others not a little hurt.
&mdash;The first thing they do after their return to their freinds is to take a good drink
of water, smoke the Pipe: &amp; after that eat, but as composedly as if they had
but just risen from a hearty meal. Their <u>Dreamed</u> sometimes order them to make a
Feast; &amp; not uncommonly tell them where to go, where they will find the animal whose
flesh is to be served up (i.e. always boiled) &amp;c. They sometimes lie in one Posture,
&amp; sometimes in another, i.e. their head to some one of the Cardinal Points. Some have
the most pleasant dreams imaginable; others indifferent. When they are to live to
a good old age(!!!) they are told..."You will see many winters! your head will grow
"quite white"; or "tho you shall never see your head white, yet you shall live
"till you are obliged to make use of a stick, &amp; long after"&mdash;"You shall die old,
"very old, respected &amp; regretted."&mdash;If they are to die young... "Thou shalt see the years of <u>a</u>
"young man"; &amp; so on of the other ages,  as well as the manner of life they shall have; &amp; the
language is not very dissimilar to that of our version of the Bible. But that stile seems to
me to be the language of Nature which <b><u>I</u></b> always find the more charming the more re-
tired the <u>speaker</u> is from the Pompous, bombastic walks of <u>high</u> life, which tho' they furnish
us with more ideas, <b><u>I</u></b> do not think adds so much to the beauty of the language.
	As I have said before, the purpose of these Dreams is to dive into futurity. Every
thing in nature appears unto them, but in the Shape of a human-being&mdash;They dream
they meet a man who asks them (after some preliminary conversation of course) "Dost
"thou know me? (who or what I am?)"&mdash;"No" "Follow me then" replies this strangers,
the indian follows&mdash;the other leads him to his abode &amp; again makes the inquiry&mdash;
the answer is perhaps as before. Then the Stranger assumes his proper form, which is
perhaps that of a Tree, a Stone, a fish &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp; after rechanging several times
in this manner, 'till such times as the Ind. becomes perfectly to know him, then this stran-
ger gives him to smoke, learns him <u>his</u> Song &amp;c. thus addressing him: "Now do
"you remember my song? .... Whenever you will wish to call upon me, Sing
"this Song, &amp; I shall not be far&mdash;I will come, &amp; do for you what you require."&mdash;
They know many of <u>these</u> <u>Spirits</u> as soon as they see them (in their dreams) by the des-
cription the other indians have given of them&mdash;some however they know from their
Nature. When The <u>Snow</u> addresses them&mdash;he they know, because he is perfectly white. The
<u>Ice</u> also. The Sun &amp; Moon from their beautifull brilliancy &amp; the elegance of their
abode. The Houses of the two last being uncommonly neat &amp; handsome, such as those of

the white (i e. civilized). One Principal amongst all these,  &amp; every thing in Nature appears
at least to some, of them, is the Supreme Being, whom they term Wee-suck-&#257; j&#257;&#257;k
(the last a's being pronounced as in, all, hawk, &amp;c.; the first as ale, bail, &amp;c.) i.e. by his Pro-
per name, his common name, Gey-Shay-mani-<u>to</u> (this is among the Crees nation),
which signifies "the Greatly charitable Spirit."  He is uncommonly good &amp; kind, addresses them,
&amp; talk to them as to children whom he most tenderly loves &amp; is extremely anxious for.  Thus far
every thing is very well, &amp; is perhaps a better <u>idea</u> than many of the vulgar Christians can give; but
on the other hand again thier Mythology, or Stories relating to him, are many of them ab-
surd &amp; indecent in the highest degree: reducing him to the level of his creatures, &amp; not
unfrequently their making him dupe;  but become so by such vile, such abominable deception as
I doubt to be equalled by the most absurd &amp; romantic of the arabian Tales; for there
are many of these Tales the author durst not publish for the obscenity &amp; inde-
cency. There are some obscene passages also in these tales (of the indians) but
not more than might be expected from a people yet in a perfect state of
nature, as to their mental Powers, to our eternal shame &amp; scandal. This one
they love, they love him a great deal, &amp; are by no means are afraid of him, because he always
addresses them "my Little Children &amp;c." &amp; all the rest of his character is of a
piece with this.&mdash;The <b>next one</b> is Old Nick&mdash;Him some term "Key-
"-jick-oh-kay" (The J being pronounced soft, as Git, or Gil, in french, for <b><u>I</u></b>
know of no English word where properly speaking the J is of any use &amp; has the
sound seemed intended by it) or "Key-jick-oh-ka<u>iw</u>". I cannot at present
give the proper signification of this name, for I am not sufficiently acquainted with
the language, but it appears to me as to mean "he who made the Day or Skies,
"or resides in the Sky" &amp;c.&mdash;This one they represent wicked, &amp; terrible; inexorable
to the highest degree; always plotting evil, &amp; endeavouring to circumvent the rest
of the creation; is always jawing &amp; bawling; but when the other appears he or-
ders him in a peremptory manner "hold thy Tongue; Get the hence, thou
"deceiver; thou ill-liver". But these words are uttered in such an authoratative
&amp; commanding tone that the Indians themselves are quite astonished, to see one who is
so uncommonly kind &amp; indulgent to them in every respect; so tender &amp; affectionate,
even in the choice of his words, assume so suddenly &amp; with so much authority so
much Power over one whose name alone they never utter but with the greatest
Dread &amp; horor. Their Horor of the Devil is so great, that no one ever utters it but
when unavoidable; &amp; if thro' inadvertancy or ignorance one of their children
should mention it he is severely reprimanded by all who hear.&mdash;

The Mermaid (or Sea-Man), The Water Lynx, or rather Tyger&mdash;a dreadful charac-
ter this last, who keeps all the Inhabitants of the deep in the Greatest Subjection&mdash;there
are however one or two who contend with him; &amp; sometimes he is reduced to the necissity of
compounding with them.  The Great Turtle, and many others. They have their abodes
in the Deep, but perfectly dry &amp; comfortable. Each one of these, &amp; indeed all of them
have their Stories or Mythology; some I forget entirely, &amp; others remember too incor-
rectly to mention at present.&mdash;&mdash;<b>[</b>These When any one Conjures, if he is a renouned
<u>Medicine</u> Man, <u>they</u> all appear, &amp; Speake to him, mostly in his own language, some
few excepted as the <u>Pike</u> (a Jack fish) who Speaks french; The Sun &amp; Moon, both speak
English; the Bull or Buffaloe in an unknown, or at least strange language; but all  per-
fectly intelligible to the Conjuror.&mdash;I am quite astray&mdash;leaving the proper thread of
my story to follow one of its branches&mdash;I ought to have said that<b>]</b> The Sun when
he appears to an indian, he is seen in the Heavens, as an Indian (i.e. a Man)"<u>walk-
ing on the Wind</u>." His dress is of a variety of Colors &amp; handsome. I had a dream,
the latter part of which I shall relate to you as it is perfectly des-
criptive of the manner or form in which the Sun appears.  I related it the next day to
some of my half-breeds, when one of them replied; "What a pity! had you now forborne
for a few days mentioning <u>this</u>, he would have appeared again to you; &amp; then you would have
had a fine opportunity of learning (from the fountain-head, as we might say) how it is the
indians come to perform those things the white will never credit:" &amp; he continued that
it was precisely the form he assumed when he appears to the indians. In my
dream I thought we were travelling a road from which some of our Party had the
utmost to dread from the ambush of an indian who could transport himself to
what place he pleased. As we were walking I happened to look above &amp; was
much struck with the appearance of a man walking in the Heavens. His
dress was that of a neat <u>Southern</u> Indian, composed mostly of red &amp; yellow, but also of a
few other colors: The Garters of his leggings  were also Neat &amp; handsome &amp; had a tuft of
Swans-down that had been Powdered with vermillion, attached to the not, on the
back part of the leg: To His shoes were attached 2 long Swan quills inclosing
the foot thus [diagram] with a tuft of down at each end &amp; in the middle on both
sides, all Powdered with vermillion&mdash;with these quills &amp; down, &amp; the down
on his Garters buoyed him up in the air. I addressed in broken Cree&mdash;he answered
in the same broken accent; upon my second address I though he did not understand more
of that language than I did myself: the Sauteux seemed to me his proper tongue &amp; I was
glad of having an opportunity of speaking that language; so I the third time addressed him
in it asked him from whence he came, whither he was going &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;He was very hi

hi, insomuch that the others thought it preprosterous in my addressing him&mdash;that he could not
hear from that distance. Upon this he came down &amp; talked with us&mdash;Saying he was an <u>ambas</u>-
<u>sador</u> &amp;c. Such is the habillement, &amp; manner in which the Sun shews himself.&mdash; The Thun-
der also appears to them, in the Shape &amp; form of a Most beautiful bird (The Pea-Cock).&mdash;
  Roots &amp; herbs also (this also ought to have come in afterwards) i.e. such as are medeci-
nal, appear, &amp; teach their votaries their respective Songs &mdash; how they must do,  what ceremonies
they must perform in taking them out of the Ground, their different applications &amp;c. &amp;c. But
these roots, herbs, &amp;c. (medecins) tho' they appear in their Dreams, they do not shew themselves
in the Conjuring Hut, box, or frame, that I learn. They are sent, as appears, by Wee-
suck-a-jaak, "to teach indians their use &amp; virtue." &amp;c., without which "they would be
very ill off, whether to heal or cure themselves, or expell the charms by which other
indians may have bewitched them" &amp;c. And tho' they are acquainted with many of
these roots &amp;c. the use &amp; virtue of some of which I can no more doubt than those used by the
Faculty in the Civilized world, yet they tell me there are several which they use to differ-
ent, &amp; some to diametrically opposite purposes.
	Their manner of Conjuring is this&mdash;in the first place a number straights poles of
2, or 2 1/2 ins. diameter &amp; about 8 or 9 feet long are prepared, i.e. cut, branched &amp; Pointed at the
lower end&mdash;they seldom require so <u>few</u> as four, commonly 6 or 8, these are planted in
the Ground from 12 to 20 or 24 ins. deep in an hexagon or octagon form, enclosing a space of
3 feet diameter, more or less&mdash;These Poles are secured by hoops,
3 or 4 in number, &amp; well tied to each pole, so that none be able to move without the
rest&mdash;This Hut, square, box, or frame, whatever it may be termed is covered with skins,
an oil cloth, or some such sort of thing.&mdash; The Conjuror is bound hand &amp; foot, not as if
he were a man going to <u>pry</u> into futurity, but as a Criminal, i.e.  <u>mere</u>,  pure
Devil &amp; one whom they intend never to loosen, so barricaded &amp; cross-corded is the creature,
sometimes all crumpled into a heap. He is tied only with his Cloute on him &amp; thus
thrust into the hut, underneath, i.e. by raising the lower covering&mdash;his "she-she-
quay" or rattler with him. Some of them sing on entering, others make a speech,
&mdash;. Here they remain some several hours, others not 5 minutes before a fluttering
is heard.  The rattler is shaked at a merry rate &amp; all of a Sudden, either from the
top, or below away flies the cords by which the indian was tied <u>into the lap</u>
<u>of he who tied him</u>. It is then that the Devil is at work&mdash;Every instant some
one or other enters, which is known to those outside by either the fluttering, the rubbing against
the skins of the hut in descending (inside) or the shaking of the rattler, &amp; sometimes all
together. When any enter, the hut moves in a most violent manner&mdash;I have fre-
quently thought that it would be knocked down, or torn out of the Ground. The first

The first who enters is commonly Meeh-key-nock (the Turtle) a jolly, jovial sort of a
fellow, who, after disencumbering his votary, chats &amp; jokes with those outside &amp; asks for a
pipe to smoke &amp;c.&mdash;There is a good deal of talking inside as may be supposed from the
number of folks collected in so small a space. To some renowned characters, all
the Spirits appear. The Thunder also frequently comes but he is desired to remain
outside as he would breake all&mdash;It is reported that he once entered &amp; split one
of the Poles into shivers. The Flying Squirrel also enters&mdash;he is no liar, but you
must take every thing he says as we do our Dreams i.e. the opposite: his nature is such
that he durst not tell the truth but in this ambiguous manner, otherwise the
conjuror would soon after die. I do not know that the Skunk ever comes, but the
Wolverine (Carcajoux) does &amp; he is known immediately by his stink, which occa-
sions no small merriment at his expense, on the outside. The <u>Loon</u> also enters
&mdash;he is known by his usual cry&mdash;"Nee-wih wee-way" repeated commonly 3 times as
he does when in the water. And this too occasions a great laugh, for these four
syllables, which form the most common Cry of that bird in the <u>Spring</u> of the
year, as every body may observe, <u>are</u> also 3 words in the Sauteux &amp; Cree languages,
which signify "I want to marry"! "I want to marry"!  "What! &amp; will you never
"have done marrying?&mdash;you were marrying all last Summer &amp; still want to"&mdash;will some
outside say, &amp; every one has his word to put in. <u>Hercules</u> also comes in&mdash;he is per-
haps as much revered by those people as even he was by the Spartans or Athenians&mdash;
His name is <b>Strong Neck</b> (&amp; every body knows how strong hercules was)&mdash;he does
not seem over fond of Jokes&mdash;&amp; when the other Spirits announce his coming all
those on the outside must cover their heads &amp; not look up; for it appears that he
cannot come <u>invisible</u> as the others do, or will not, but still does not chuse
to be seen. "Once upon a time his arrival was announced, &amp; every body was ordered
"to cover themselves, so as not to see (this, &amp; all such like orders are commands sent to
"the Conjuror, &amp; which he, (being inside) must <u>Promulgate</u> to those on the outside)&mdash;
"&mdash;there was one young Buck however who wanted to shew himself supe-
"rior to these orders &amp; divert his freinds, would not cover himself&mdash;Hercules
"entered&mdash;&amp; at that time, as at all others, he was not in too good a humor&mdash;Some alter-
"cation ensued &amp; "I am Strong Neck" said he "Pah! says the young man at last,
"the neck of my os-Pubis indeed is strong"! This raised a most violent laugh, but
"the young man was lost&mdash;he disappeared from amongst them, &amp; was never after
"heard of. Since <u>that</u> time they are rather more cautious. Some of the <u>Ancients</u>
also enter&mdash;they are called "O-may-me-thay-day-ce-cee-wuck" i.e. <u>Hairy</u> <u>breasts</u>

such as the ancients are said to be.. These are great boasters&mdash;they recount the exploits of
their younger days, apparently with the greatest satisfaction; say "I used to do so &amp; so
"on such occasions&mdash;I never shot a Moose or Buffaloe, but pursued them on my feet,
"&amp; ripped them open with my knife &amp;c."  But this is only <u>wind</u>, for no sooner do other
powerful ones enter, but these Chaps search to secret themselves. The Sun enters&mdash;speakes
very bad English at the offset, but by degrees becomes to speake it very easily &amp; fluently&mdash;He
is Gun Smith &amp; watch-maker, or at least can repair them. When he is entered there
is commonly a beautiful clear light visible, through the covering&mdash;He neither does not
admit of too much familiarity; but is still good natured &amp; condescending. The Pike
or Jack fish, also enters; as the Sun, they also speak (French,) badly enough at the offset,
"When there are 2 or 3 on the outside who can speake french &amp; address him together,
"merely to perplex &amp; bother him, he laughs at their folly &amp; says 'you may talk
"'20 or 100 of you together if you chuse, yet are you not able to perplex me&mdash;come as
 "'numerous as you chuse, yet are there many more of us <u>Pike</u> that you frenchmen'"
&mdash;he is very familiar too. The Bull, or Buffaloe is  understood only by the Conjuror,
his voice being hoarse, &amp; rough&mdash;his language quite foreign&mdash;the Conjurer must
interpret when any thing is wanted of him.&mdash;As is his voice, so are his manners&mdash;
&mdash;however, he will joke a little too; but let them beware not to let drop anything
in a sarcastic or contemptuous manner as to his power, or knowledge of the future for he
takes it up &amp; reproves in a very tart manner; &amp; in a way too that conveys no com-
fortable ideas to any one present,  for they all endeavour to excuse it by saying it is
only a Joke, "I know Jokes too; &amp; I can laugh, &amp; understand the nature of laughing as
"well as the best amongst you, but such language is unbecoming &amp; I will have no
"more of it."&mdash;&mdash;"A half breed one time, <u>because</u> <u>his</u> <u>father</u> <u>was</u> <u>a</u> <u>french</u> <u>man</u>
"thought he might go any lengths he pleased with him (the B.)&mdash;he replied very
"warmly thus: "how durst thou doubt anything I say&mdash;Knowest thou not how clearly

Spirits as I've already said the by standers (or setters for they are seated on the
Ground round about) are very familiar&mdash;The Turtle is one of them, he is very hu-
mersome, &amp; their jokes with him were such (for I've heard this myself) as I should
have been ashamed to hold even with a bawd&mdash;it was pure <u>ribaldry</u>: but they durst
not doubt him when he speaks seriously; for he is very powerful &amp; makes himself
respected when he thinks it necessary. "Who is that, now speaking?" said one of the in-
dians (this I was told)&mdash;"It is Mihkenach" said the Conjuror&mdash;if it be him, prove it
"&mdash;take him in your hand &amp; show him to us"  Now the Conjr. was a very great me-
"decin man,&mdash;he took the turtle upon his hand, raised the covering of his <u>box</u>,

"small, scarcely more than 2 ins. long. When all had gazed enough the Conjurer
"drew him in.&mdash;The Turtle was very quiet while out but as soon as he got in

"was afraid some of them would have attempted to take me in their hands &amp;

beast &amp; makes a devil of a racket. Towards the latter end master Keyjickah-

up his own (i.e. the Devils) racket, jawing &amp; blabing, scolding &amp; giving the lie to &amp;
abusing all hands: the indians are hurt &amp; displeased, but durst not say anything&mdash;they must
swallow all quietly, &amp; then it is that the Conjuror most dreads for his own <u>bacon</u>:
this however does not last very long for Weesuckajaak (the Supreme Being) enters last

fond of Weesuckajâck&mdash;he commonly speaks to this effect "My Little (i.e. Grand) Children
"I am very indulgent &amp; kind, I am very charitable, &amp; love you  much,&mdash;a great deal more

"because he is wickedly inclined&mdash;mischief &amp; destruction are in his nature&mdash;he greives at any
"good he sees: take ye heed, beware of him for he is ever on the watch to destroy you"
&mdash;When <u>Charly</u> enters after some abuse he calls out "Get ye hence, get ye hence, what
"are ye doing so long from your home: off with ye immediately"; &amp; rubs up &amp; down
the skins that form the covering lest any should be hid. Thus he sends off all the
Spirits, who, as they <u>fly</u> off, as well as when they enter, give this frame a terrible
shaking. It may be supposed what sort of a shaking he gives as he comes &amp; goes, &amp;
how he shakes the rattler;&mdash;for they all shake the rattler on entering. When We-
suckajaak goes off, all is done.&mdash;
    Some Conjurors are so powerful that the <u>hut</u> they enter, must be doubled; that is two
rows or Setts of Poles one on the outside the other, &amp; each row fastened with good
strong hoops well tied, after which the outer &amp; inner row are also fastened&mdash;thus
arranged, they seem to be beyond the power of any 3 or 4 men to move, yet when the
Spirits enter it sets a-going with a motion equal to that of a Single pole indifferently stuck
in the Ground &amp; violently moved by a man. I have never seen any of these double
ones, but twice or thrice saw the others, whilst the conjuror was in&mdash;Some time
afterwards, when they were off, I shook them with both hands &amp; with all my strength,
but the motion was nothing like that of the Conjurors. I have been told that
those who enter these Double ones, are so powerful that almost all the Creation
comes to see them, &amp; they are shaken with uncommon violence. This motion
the Conjurors say is produced by the concussion of the air; i.e. the Spirits come
&amp; enter with such velocity that it is the <u>Wind</u> <u>they</u> <u>Produce</u> which occasions it.
The conjuror is all the while seated Peaceably in the bottom, (on the Ground) of his
hut. Some of them to shew their Power have had small sticks of the hardest
wood (such as produces the wild Pear, &amp; of which the Indians make their arrows, &amp;
ram-rods &amp;c. for Guns) about the size of a mans finger, made as sharp point-
ed as possible, &amp; dried, when they become in consequence nearly as dangerous as iron,
or bayonets&mdash;Some have 18, 24 more or less, tho' Seldom less than 18 planted in the
bottom of their hut&mdash;They are about 12 or 14 ins. out of the Ground&mdash;On the Points of these
Sticks is the conjuror placed, sometimes on his bottom, at others on his
knees &amp; elbows, &amp; there he remains as quietly &amp; composedly as if he were on
"<u>a</u> <u>bed</u> <u>of</u> <u>Roses</u>"; &amp; when he comes off no marks of injury appear, tho he entered
naked, only his Cloute about him, &amp; of course the Cords with which he is
tied. "Their familiars (their Dreamed, or those who appear to them in their dreams &amp;
Promise them their assistance &amp; Protection) support them so that no injury hap-
pens them"!!! __________________

March 29th- I feel but very indifferently disposed to write; but I am on the eve of an accumula-
tion of business &amp; may not, after a few days, have the necessary time, so that I shall risk.
	A Couple of days back I have been conversing with a Cree (indian) who by <u>peace-meal</u>
gives me the following account of their mythology:&mdash;"The North-(wind) apparently one of
oldest of created rational beings thus addressed his daughter, his only child  "My
"daughter! be very careful, &amp; remember that anything you do, or wherever you go, on turn-
ing yourself, turn <u>always</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>direction</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>Sun</u>, &amp; <u>never</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>contra</u>-
<u>ry</u> <u>direction</u>." Now women are a compound of Perverseness, obstinacy &amp; curiosity; &amp; withall
forgetful enough too, <u>sometimes</u>. This Girl one day she was chopping fire-wood, without
thinking of her fathers admonition, in going to another Tree, turned round
to the right, in a contrary direction to the Sun, &amp; instantly fell to the Ground, &amp;
died. The time she used to take up in this occupation, being expired, her Parents became
very uneasy, &amp; after some search found her on her <u>back</u>, dead, &amp; her belly swolen to an enor-
mous size. The father &amp; mother, on each or opposite sides, contemplated her si-
tuation with great grief. At last the Father arose, stood up, &amp; made a long
speech, praying to "The Father of Life" to have mercy &amp; compassion on his child.
His speech was not ineffectual: the Girl was delivered of a Boy, &amp; shortly after, of another&mdash;
The Elder was called Wee-suck-a-jock; the younger "Mi (or Mee) shaw-bôse"&mdash;
After this the Girl recovered &amp; became as aforetime. These two young men immedi-
ately attained "mans estate"&mdash;i.e. to manhood, &amp;c. and became hunters.  The
younger of the two one day was in pursuit of a Grey, or rein Deer (Carriboeuf) after
which also pursued a Wolf. The Deer having thus no hopes of escape fled to a
rock on the edge of the waters &amp; plunged in, Mishabôse &amp; the Wolf followed; but they
all three became a prey to the Michi-Pichoux, or Great Lynx, i.e. water Lynx,
water-Cat, or water Dog. Wesuckajock was very uneasy for his brother, was
anxious to revenge his death, but scarcely knew-well how. At last one day seeing
a Kings-fisher hovering in a certain spot addressed him thus "My younger
"Brother! what art thou there looking at?"  "I am looking at Mishabôse, your
"brother, lying in the bottom of the deep, drowned" &amp;c. After some further con-
versation, Weesuck. discovered the means of avenging himself. He accordingly set to
work &amp; made himself a <u>large</u> <u>Canoe</u>, on board of which he embarked the Moose, Deer,
Bear, otter, Beaver, muskrat, wolf &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp; repaired to the place where the
Sea Lynxes used to resort to sleep; this was a fine pleasant place on
the Land. Here he observed several of them &amp; began his work. It is not related
how many he did kill, but the waters upon their death came rushing upon
him in a violent torrent; as he expected this, he had bro't his canoe near hand,
but before he reached it, after killing his enemies, he was already knee-deep in the

in the water: however he got safely on board; but in his hurry forgot to embark a little earth.
&mdash;Now the waters swelled immensely, &amp; in a very short time the highest land was cover'd
&amp; Weesuckajock was tossed about by the wind &amp; water. It appears that he had not the fore-
sight either of taking with him a sufficiency of Provisions for he became very hungry,
&amp; thus expressed himself to his crew. After some time he saw some-
thing on the water, very large &amp; moving towards him: He thus addressed it, "Who,
"or what, art thou my younger brother? (for he being the first born, always addressed
the rest of the creation, whether animate, inanimate, or rational or not, as his <u>younger</u>
"<u>Brothers</u>) &amp; whither art thou going?" "Why! my Elder (brother) I am a <u>water</u> <u>Lynx</u>,
"&amp; am sent by <u>Confrers</u> in search of Weesuck. &amp; to destroy him" "Aye! is it so indeed?
"&amp; how or with with instrument do you intend to destroy him?" "I have a large &amp;
"very strong Iron-tail, with which if I smite his Canoe, he must perish?" Wee-
suckajock seeing his danger tho't to get off by duplicity &amp; dissimulation &amp; thus
continued: "Indeed you must have a very extraordinary <u>tail</u> my <u>Younger</u> ....
"come near, &amp; let me see it, how it is made &amp;c."&mdash;The Lynx drew up, present-
ed his tail, Weesuck. took hold as to look on it, &amp; placed it on the Gunnel
of his Canoe &amp; with a stone cut it off saying,"Now go to thy friends, &amp; tell
"them how Weesuck. has served thee."&mdash;He retired doubled quick, grieved,
ashamed, &amp; not with a little pain. "Ha!" said the water Lynxes on perceiving
the situation of their  companion, "ha! weesuck. is cunning, &amp; too powerful,
"we must destroy him for our own safety." "Come, now, who amongst us will
"volunteer, &amp; go to destroy that enemy of ours?" &mdash;They at last pitched upon an enor-
mous Beaver &amp; thus addressed him at his departure "Go thou our Brother, Destroy
"that mutual enemy of ours,  be not afraid of him for he is not worthy of fear; but still be cau-
"tious, for he is very artful." Weesuck. descryed him also, &amp; the same addresses &amp;
compliments passed as with the first. And how do you intend to destroy Weesuck?"
"with my teeth." Well then do come near &amp; let me see them." x x x  The beaver
drew up, &amp; shewed his teeth: weesuck. put his hand on his head &amp; while exclaiming "What
"terrible teeth!&mdash;how immensely broad &amp; sharp&mdash;they are like large axes!" he
with his other hand took up a large stone &amp; with a dreadful blow broke them
all in his head. "Now go to thou too friends &amp; tell them how Weesuck. hath served
"thee." Indeed the beaver did go, sniffling &amp; blowing &amp; yelling.  The Lynxes were
astonished, &amp; durst no more attempt anything at him.  His situation however
was very disagreable, very uncomfortable, &amp; what added to it was his want of
food.  He thus addressed his companions one day. "Come now we very repre-
"hensibly forgot to bring earth with us, &amp; who knows how long this will conti-

"continue?&mdash;which of you all will endeavour to get a little earth for me out of which I
"shall try to make <u>Land</u> for us to live on?&mdash;whoever will go shall be amply rewarded."
They all said it was very deep. There was scarcely an hopes. Then he said to the otter
"Go thou my <u>Younger</u> (brother) &amp; if thou diest in the attempt, I shall restore thee to life,
"&amp; make thee immortal". Saying this he tied a long leather thong to his tail &amp; sent him
down: he found the otter was dead, hauled him up in to the canoe, rubbed him dry
&amp; blowed in his nostrils, when he revived. Then he sent the Musk rat: "Come my
"little brother,  go thou, thou art small &amp; very active, art fond of the water, &amp; goeth to great
"depths&mdash;thy reward shall be as that of the otter." The rat was secured with a thong
also &amp; down he went. Weesuck found he was dead: hauled him up, &amp; was extre-
mely happy to find he had some earth in his little paws &amp; mouth: he restored
him to life as he did the otter, &amp; sent him down again, when he bro't up his mouth as
full as it could hold &amp; a good deal in his <u>hands</u> which he held pressed to breast.
	Now weesuck. took this earth &amp; made a ball of it, &amp; blew in it a considerable
time &amp; sent off the Wolf to make its circuit to see if it was large enough. After
four nights he returned &amp; thus spake "My Elder, the earth is indeed Large &amp; beautiful; but our
"number now is small: when we will increase it will be too small for us: we
"will be all upon top of each other (i.e we will be in each others way &amp;c.), &amp; if you
"make man as you contemplate,...it will be much moreso." Weesuck then blew
it out again &amp; once more sent the Wolf-- He was 8 nights absent, &amp; reported it
still too small. Weesuck then blew it out for a long time &amp; sends the wolf
again. But before he went off he said "My Elder, the Earth must now be very
"large, &amp; I shall possibly be too much wearied to make its circuit: I shall traverse,
"&amp; if I find any thing to assure me of its being large enough I shall <u>howl</u>,
"which will be a sign to you; &amp; whatever place may suit me there will I make my resi-
dance." After several nights absence they heard him howl, wherefore they all
concluded the Earth was sufficiently Large. Weesuck. then <u>blessed</u> the others &amp; sent
them away telling them to multiply "&amp; be good, not vicious or ill inclined, nor se-
"cret, or hide themselves too much from <u>My</u> little brothers (the human beings
which he was about to create) when they might want to eat" &amp;c. &amp;c. Now
after this he became very lonesome &amp; bethout himself of making <u>Indians</u>
i.e. human beings. He in consequence took up a stone &amp; fashioned it into
the form of a man; but whilst at this work it struck him that by forming
them of so strong &amp; hard a substance that in time when they would become to
know their nature, they would grow insolent &amp; rebellious &amp; be a great a great an-
noyance to each other &amp; of course also, would never die. "This will not do, I must

"I must make them of a more weake &amp; fragible substance, "so that they may live a reas-
"reasonable time &amp; behave as becomes human beings." Upon this he took up a handful
of common Earth &amp; made the form of a man, &amp; blew into his nostrils the <u>breath of life</u>.
	The Moon formed the Female, as Wesuck. did the Male, hence the reason of the Pe-
riodical return of their sickness with that of the moon, "as also among the Sluts." (Bitches).
Hence also all women are forbidden when they go out from the calls of nature, &amp; that <u>one</u> in
particular, to look at the moon while thus employed. Those who are thus for-
getful, ignorant, or obstinate immediately find the effect by the return &amp;c. x x x.
I should have said that he bruised the stone to Pieces, altho' a great part of it was
already formed. For the white (I believe it was the Moon again) he made a Part-
ner for him of one of his ribs &amp; another piece, which he wrapped in a handker-
chief &amp; laid beside him saying "this, by the time thou risest, shall be a full
"grown Woman &amp; shall be thy companion" &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash;After all this done, he
made a separation in the Earth, one part of which was a beautiful
plain meadow Ground, &amp; the rest Woody; &amp; then set off travelling in the
Earth. He took a partner to himself, by whom he had a son. This soon got to mans
estate, but had a great aversion to the female Sex, which gave his Parents a great
deal of anxiety, all their trouble, all their remonstrances were to no effect: at
last the father betho't of a plan in which he was sure of success. "He transformed him-
"self into a most beautiful woman &amp; when the Son was returned from his hunting
"well Son! said the Mother, here is a young &amp; handsome woman we have procured
"merily for thee; does she please thee?"&mdash;Her <u>charms</u> were so great the young man
immediately became extremely fond of her. But this, in the end, became the
source of much trouble to both Parents &amp; of disgrace to the father particular-
ly. The mother became jealous &amp; vexed on her son's account that he should so
be imposed upon, &amp; done many shameful things to her husband."  Here follows
a train of Stories the most indecent, &amp; shameful &amp; sometimes obscene, that one can
well imagine. But these people are yet, so far as regards their faculties, in a
state of Nature. Every thing appears reasonable &amp; natural &amp; must be very
gross &amp; palpable indeed when they do not give credit to them. Their language
is also that of nature, &amp; they speake out what they think&mdash;they do not use circumlocu-
tion to avoid an indecent term, nor have they flourishes to embellish their dis-
courses; &amp; their speeches, to my taste, at least, are far more pleasing &amp; natural
than those strained &amp; laboured compositions we meet with amongst ourselves. But this is
not the place for these discussions.&mdash;&mdash;

<u>-April 4th 1823}</u> There is a sick indian with me whom I have been obliged to feed with his whole
family all winter, not being able to endure the cold on his lungs, &amp; in a manner deserted by
his friends. To get as near the truth as I can possibly do in all things relating to their
mythology, I frequently converse with him on these subjects; &amp; when "<u>not</u> <u>forbid</u>-
<u>den</u> <u>by</u> <u>his</u> <u>Dreamed</u> <u>or</u> <u>familiars</u>" is explicit enough. A few nights back he
thus informed me upon the several questions I proposed. The one that I saw in my
dream as above related <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>the</u> <u>Sun</u>, as my half-breeds told me. The
Sun is dressed like a Gentleman, i.e  a short coat, waistcoat, short breeches, stock-
ings, boots, a hat &amp; a beautiful feather stuck in it. He speakes English &amp;c. and
the rest as mentioned above. But the one I mentioned above, is <b>Sickness</b>, or
the Plague. There are four of them: two walking in the air as I mentioned, &amp; two <u>in</u>
the earth, i.e. in the bowels of the earth at a certain moderate distance from
the surface, perhaps in the same <u>proportion</u> as those who are above. The indian
thus relates of him: "When I was a young man, he appeared to me, &amp; told me his
"name was Sickness; &amp; that every time a <u>general</u> sickness was to take place
"amongst us he would come &amp; forwarn me. See: Four winters ago (in 1819) after
"we had taken debt in the fall &amp; were proceding each of us to our hunting Grounds
"he appeared to me one night &amp; said, 'I am come to tell you to get out of the way
"'of all <u>Large</u> <u>waters</u> (i.e. Lakes &amp; rivers) &amp; pitch off immediately into the woods:
"'Be cautious also &amp; select proper ground for an encamping; never pitch your
"'tents in Large high Woods, particularly of the Pine kind, chuse <u>low</u> <u>woods</u>
"'to encamp in &amp; never look up to Gaze lest I see you see &amp; you be
"'smitten. Keep off, always from Large waters, for I am on a circuit round
"'the earth: I shall follow the travelling waters (i.e. The routes or roads
"'usually frequented or navigated) &amp; smite all those I there find with
"'sickness: in the interior, or to one side I shall not go. Tell this to the
"'indians that they keep out of the way.'" It was that year that the <u>Measles</u>
made such havock in some places. He thus continued, "This last fall (in December)
"I saw him again&mdash;he told me he was on another circuit &amp; intended making a
"large selection, passing thro' the plains &amp; coming down again this way. He said
"he would pass when the leaves would be rather large (about the 20<u>th</u> June,
"in these parts) &amp; told me as before to admonish every body to keep out of the
"way of <u>large</u> <u>waters</u>, trees &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;'It is not my doings, nor is it my choice
"'that I thus <u>prowl</u> thro' the earth, said he, but I am sent, &amp; cannot resist'&mdash;
"Now we will be again this spring visited with some sickness, but I cannot
"tell which&mdash;it is a breaking out in the flesh &amp;c.  and his appearing to you

"to you (i.e. me) is a sign that he will certainly pass." I then asked him if he intend-
ed telling the other indians of it. "I shall tell my Elder (brother), but not the others, for they
"wont beleive me." He was very diffident: he wanted to communicate to me all he
was told, but said he durst not lest he should injure himself, by exasperating the other
(i.e <u>Sickness</u>) &amp; being <u>enigmatically</u> forbidden!&mdash;"He told me, continued the indian,
"as a sign that two of our number should die this winter, one a small one (&amp; <u>he</u> is dead
"naming to me a child that died about that time, tho' very distant then from him)
"and the other a full grown person&mdash;whom he is I know not, <u>but one</u> <u>must</u> <u>die</u>!
These Chaps seldom appear (in dreams) less than 4 times, but commonly 6 times,
&amp; each time in a different form 'till the last, when he <u>makes</u> <u>himself</u> <u>known</u>,
&amp; ever after appear<u>s</u> (or rather appear) in the same uniform manner. It
is then, after they have made themselves completely known to their votaries,
that they communicate their power &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and teach their their <u>songs</u>
which tho' in their dreams, are so indelibly imprinted in their memories that they are
never forgotten. For every one of these Spirits, Genii, demons, phantasies, or whatever
you may please to term them, have each their <u>Song</u>, which they communicate
to their votaries, as well as explain also their power. Hence it is, that when any
any one amongst them has dreamed of a certain number, commonly a good
many, 20, 30, or perhaps a thousand, that they can <u>conjure</u> when they please; for
these like the guardian Genii in the fables, keeps always near them, &amp; pro-
tect them from <u>too</u> much injury from the evil machinations of some
of the mischievous ones. Indeed, from what I can learn, there are but few of
these <u>familiars</u> but do do evil to their votaries if they (the votary, i.e. the in-
dian) neglect performing the regular annual, or perhaps more distant
periodical sacrifice; and this sacrifice, their <u>familiar</u> tells them what it is he expects.
A few days ago, in the night between the 31<u>st</u> March &amp; 1<u>st</u> April, this indian was
sleeping in an old house I sent him to, when at a late hour in the night he was pulled most
violently out of his bed; so that his wife that was lying beside him, awoke &amp; with
difficulty kept him down, tho' he also struggled himself to  make his <u>Fami</u>-
<u>liar</u> leave his hold: &amp; the house shook violently. The next day he sent me his
wife to ask a like a little grease to make a sacrifice (i.e. burnt offering X)&mdash;I gave
her a little, &amp; the husband came the same evening to sleep with us. Upon en-
quiring he told me thus. "It was a <u>Skeleton</u>: he <u>was</u> displeased with me because
"I did not make him my usual offering &amp; yet he knows that I am <u>pitiful</u>,
"that I cannot move to hunt myself, but am beholding to others for every
"mouthful I &amp; my family eat; but they are wicked when they think themselves

X God forgive me the comparison, which by the bye is not meant to ridicule, but is really the case.

neglected or abandoned, &amp; think nothing of carrying off an indian &amp; throwing him in some
distant place, dangerous precipice, or other place where he must perish if not succored
by some other more kind one. "Some years back continued he, I went out one night
"in the fall to hunt moose. I had tied  my Canoe very securely in the rushes &amp;
"there was waiting alone to hear the moose either come to the Lake, or cry after the
"Dam, for it was in the rutting Season (&amp; the indians commonly go out in this
manner at that season, for the Buck has a certain cry which he makes at that
time either to call the female, or as with the domestic cattle to exult as one
might think from their capers) "I all at once heard far a-head of me cries of heh, heh!
"heh (or hayh,  or haih) sudden, quick, coming in the air, &amp; directly towards me 'oh!
"'now said I, I am gone'!&mdash;Indeed he came&mdash;I <u>crinjed</u> &amp; laid myself as low in my
"Canoe as possible; but he came straight to me, took me up &amp; threw me in the
"water, all the time crying he'! he'!&mdash;I then endeavoured to take out my <u>fire</u>-
"<u>bag</u>; but this he would not let me do. Having then no alternative, I was obliged
"to make for the shore as well as I could, he all the time crying in the same man-
"ner just above my head, as if he intended absolutely my death. However I reached
"the shore, tho' with the greatest difficulty. Then I took some dry grass which
 "I rubbed &amp; bruised 'till it became soft &amp; put it under my arm pits &amp; crumpled
"myself into a small heap &amp; remained 'till the sun began to warm when I
"swam back to my Canoe. He kept hovering over me all night &amp; until the Sun was
"pretty high, always making the same cry; tho' when he found me so benumbed with
"cold on my debarkation he laughed, ha! ha! ha!" &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;Today (Apr. 4<u>th</u>)
he asked me for a needle &amp; thread to sew the sleeve of his Capot, which this <u>Ghost</u>!
had torn in his endeavours to carry him off the other night. Whilst he was sewing
"how he has vexed me, said he, by tearing my old Coat, but I am afraid of him."&mdash;
&mdash;He related me another story of <u>them</u> as follows. "I went out one
"time a hunting beaver with a friend of mine: It was a long distance from our
"lodges&mdash;we killed 6 Beavers, &amp; slept out. I awoke in the night &amp; was
"much astonished to observe a man seated on the opposite side of the fire, resting his head on both
"hands, with his elbows on his knees apparently in a very pensive, sullen manner. He had but skin &amp; bone&mdash;not the least particle of
"flesh; &amp; <u>this</u> one had hair on his bony head. I gently pushed my friend &amp; told him to
"look at <u>that</u> <u>stranger</u>. We were both extremely agitated in consequence of our fear,
"&amp; were at a loss what to do. Having no alternative, I arose, conceiving he came to
"ask for something to eat I took a Beaver, cut it in two &amp; presented him the half of
"it: he did not deign to look at it&mdash;I was much afraid. I then bethought
"of cutting it into mouthfuls, which after presenting him I threw into the fire&mdash;
"thus I did with the whole; &amp; when done, he arose &amp; walked off peaceably in the <u>air</u>."

tuation disappear from the Earth &amp; go to reside with  all those who have already departed
in that distressed state. This band or congregation have a head or chief&mdash;Their
color is commonly green, tho' sometimes black; &amp; it is extremely uncommon
when one has even any hair, being bald&mdash;as if a blown bladder. They sometimes are heard in
the day. The nois is sometimes as of a quantity of dried bones rattled or shaken in
a forcible manner in a kettle; &amp; sometimes as above related making that same
monotonous but frightful cry of he'h! he'h! very quick &amp; with an abrupt ter-
mination. The sacrifice they offer to these is Grease, generally a large bladder full,
&amp; of the best kind. All the natives present are invited. Tobacco of course goes before every
thing else. He who makes the feast, or his assistant, most commonly lights, or fills
rather, the pipes of all who smoke, but when it is light it is first presented to
that quarter where <u>these</u> are supposed to reside (I believe in the N. W. or West)
then to the cardinal points&mdash;then to the (bladder of) Grease which is put is put
in a dish fit to contain it &amp; covered with down. Some of them have a small
board about 20 or 24 ins. long, flat, painted with red earth, &amp; a head made to it, of the
same piece, &amp; flat as the rest. At a certain distance below the neck, as we might
suppose the Shoulders, other small pieces made in the same form &amp; about 3 or
4 ins. long are stuck in each side at short distances, reaching to the ground&mdash;
the lower end being small, &amp; the head end would bear some resemblance to the
ribs or arms were there not so many, by their being somewhat in a hanging form.
After smoking &amp; somes speeches, in which these Ghosts are addressed&mdash;He who makes
the feast, <u>waves</u> it 3 times crying he! he! very loud for a good many times, &amp; then
presents it to this board, which is intended as a representative of the Pahkack,
desiring <u>him</u> to accept it, &amp; be propitious &amp; merciful to them, neither to injure them
nor their <u>little</u> <u>ones</u>. Then He dances 3 times round the tent (in the inside) &amp;
when he comes to the 4th time, the one seated next him (in the direction of the
Sun) rises. He makes a feint of offering it twice to the one who rises, who in his
turn <u>does</u> as if he was going to receive it; &amp; the 3d time it is thrown into
his hands: this one makes a double turn upon his heels &amp; dances or <u>trots</u> once round the
tent, &amp; the next him, seated, rises to take it in his turn, with the same ceremony,  'till all
have passed.  Then it comes into the masters hands again who reperform the same
ceremonies once more,&mdash;puts down the Grease, cuts it up, &amp; shares to every male or
widow present, in proportion to their numbers (i.e. the families they may have.&mdash;Shortly after my arrival here this last
fall they invited me thro' compliment to two of these feasts&mdash;I went both times merely

merely to have a better opportunity of making my observations, which are as above, as near as I
can bring them.  But my mind was too much disturbed with reflections which soon
became so melancholy that I had nothing to bestow on what was going on. Poor
unfortunate creatures! I often exclaimed to myself&mdash;Ye are desirous, nay anxious to perform
your duties to your maker, but know not how. If you only knew how he abomi-
nates this ceremony which you perform with so much devotion, how soon would
you cast off all your superstitions, &amp; rather live without any religion at all, &amp;  risk
all upon chance, than perform sacrifices, for aught I know, to demons!  I shall not
here enter upon these reflections further, suffice the above; for they are too long, too
frequent, &amp; besides I wish to sacrifice the little paper I have remaining to
such other things as I have, &amp; which I think may not be quite uninter-
esting to you.  Had there  been but their speeches, &amp; the ceremonies, I should
not perhaps have thought so deeply.  But their cries of he! he! &amp; ha! ha! &amp;c. so repeated
&amp; vociferous, that I was struck with a certain horror &amp; thought that half of the
devils in hell had entered the throats of these men to  give <u>me</u> an idea of their
Pandemonium below. Good God! what a miserable reflection! but how much
moreso the occasion leading to it is.&mdash;
      Notwithstanding they some times <u>Dream</u> of roots (medecines &amp;c.) there is a certain place accord-
ing to their notions consecrated to <u>Esculapius</u> (&amp; Perhaps Appollo also, conjointly). It is depicted
as a most heavenly abode, so delightful. He (<u>Esculapius</u>) resides in a mountain in the
bowels of which is his house&mdash;it has 6 doors, but so mysteriously constructed that no soul
whatever, besides himself &amp; his <u>inmates</u> of whom there are a great number (of Every Nation
&amp; language) can open them&mdash;The Lock apparently is in the form of a Screw, or
Spiral, &amp; is opened on the inside, but only to such as Escu. deems worthy of admis-
sion These doors open <u>to</u> different quarters, the house being immensely large, &amp; as above mentioned,
in the bowels of y<u>e</u> mountain: <u>In</u> this residance is of every medicine useful in life, such as
do not <b><u>vegetate</u></b>, i.e. minerals, fossils, &amp;c. &amp;c. These are shown to the votary; he is instruct-
ed in their use;  the manner of preparing &amp; mixing them; the ceremonies, i.e. songs &amp; sacrifices,
&amp;c. &amp;c. to be performed in their application, taking of them up, or in instructing <u>others</u>;
because it is not every <u>Indian</u> that is favored with these Dreams. The mountain is of a
moderate size, &amp; there issue from it 40 Rivers which fall into a Lake not far
from the <u>base</u> &amp; situated in a beautiful plain&mdash;this  Lake is shallow &amp; has some
handsome sandy shoals, &amp; in the borders of (in the water) it grow beautiful <u>rushes</u>.
The water in every one of these rivers is of a different color, no two being alike, one is
Black, another white, red, Green, blue, <u>ash</u>-<u>color</u> &amp;c. &amp;c. <b><u>In</u></b> the latter grow herbs &amp;
plants of a vast variety, as also their nature. In the sides of the mountain are of every
of every herb &amp; plant that grows in any part of the world whatever. When any one of them

(of the indians I mean) is thus favored, he appears first at these rivers, when the head or Chief of the Mountain
comes out, accost him in a freindly manner, &amp; after some conversation he is introduced into the
interior of the house, where he is astonished to find people of every nation &amp; language in the
earth. But if I can form a right opinion, there are but few of each language.&mdash;They
are seated in Four rows, their seats being something like those of a Theatre, semicircu-
lar &amp; rising a little one above the other. These are all Doctors; &amp; it is their business
to instruct the <u>votary</u> in the object of his mission &amp;c. They have a great quantity of
medecines already prepared, of such as are produced in the bowels of the Earth, such
as minerals, stones, shells &amp;c. &amp;c. and most, or many of these, are hung up in the
house. Here is he is taught how, &amp; in what manner, to prepare these, as also the
Songs &amp; sacrifices &amp;c. appropriate to each different one or sort.  When on the
outside,  or out-of-Doors, he is shewn all the roots, herbs, plants &amp;c. and is taught
the respective Song (of each) or of any particular one, or number, or such
only as grow in the climate he inhabits. Both the Songs &amp; the Plant, herb &amp;c.
are so indelibly imprinted on his mind (or memory), tho' he had never seen
them before, or should not happen to meet with any of them for years afterwards, yet
on his first view, he immediately recognises them, &amp; every circumstance that had been
instructed him, as if he had passed a regular apprenticeship.  This may seem very
extraordinary, if not indeed absurd to people unacquainted with them, but still it
is no less a positive fact. These rivers i.e. waters are of different colors, so also is the <u>rapidity</u>
of each stream; some of them moving in a turbulent &amp; awful manner as the rapids
&amp; eddies at the foot of Large falls; some moving in large majestic waves likes the
swells of a large &amp; Deep Lake agitated by the wind;  &amp; some in a beautiful
smooth current, down which the <u>canoes</u> are scarcly perceived to move. These
are the tokens or signs or emblems of the manner of <u>our</u> lives, here below, so far as regards to
health &amp; sickness, &amp; of course the description requires no further explanation.
In some of these rivers grow herbs or plants which, themselves, as well as their roots,
are a rank, deadly poison, more or less; &amp; their effects, when any Demon-Spirited wretch
employes them as instruments of vengeance, tho' I have known none to carry
off the object <u>immediately</u>,  yet have a most melancholy baneful effect; some of
them exactly similar (in their effects) to <u>Lunar Caustic</u>, &amp; oftentimes  with an ad-
ditional <u>humiliating</u> effect (But more of this hereafter) &amp; some, deprive the ob-
ject of every one of his senses but that of feeling&mdash;a melancholy instance of this I saw in
the Spring of 1813 &amp; sufficient of itself to <u>emeliate</u> an heart of adamant! Some
times Esculapius will not instruct his votary in their use, satisfying himself  with
telling them <u>they</u> <u>are</u> <u>bad</u> <u>medecines</u>, or perhaps not mentioning them at all. To others
again, he explained every <u>circumstance</u> &amp;c. relating to them; but with a <u>most</u> <u>strict</u>

injunction never to employ them at his <u>Peril</u> "unless you wish to die: I teach you all these
"these things because I love you, &amp; know your heart to be compassionate: but <u>mind</u> <u>my</u>
"<u>words</u>, if ever you employ them with an ill or evil <u>view</u>, thou shalt die. Other <u>indians</u>
"as well as thyself, love life&mdash;it is sweet to every body; render it therefore not a bur-
"then or a <u>disgrace</u>; &amp; I <u>hate</u> those who thus abuse my confident affection" &amp;c. &amp;c.
They are also forbidden sometimes as strictly, &amp; for the same reasons, instructing
others in their use. Notwithstanding this great love &amp; cautious diffidence of Escu-
lapius, there are other malignant Powers who teach them &amp; encourage their use.
&mdash;Hence those distressing objects I cannot here for the want of Paper,  speake of&mdash;
    What I have mentioned of minerals &amp;c. which from their description are indeed really
such, i.e. minerals &amp;c. yet I cannot  take upon myself from my slender knowledge of their
language &amp; <u>technical</u> terms, to <u>assure</u> you that they are prepared after <u>our</u> manner,
i.e. by Chemical processes. Mercury, sulphur, saltpetre or nitre &amp;c. I do not know that they
have; but there being french, English, German, &amp; from the description Greek &amp; Hebrew
Doctors, among the number, I should not suppose it preposterous in concluding that they
have them all in the same way as ourselves. But from what I can learn it is <u>Stones</u>,
that is, some particular kinds of them that are most used, such as <u>talk</u>, pumice stones,
&amp; various other kinds.  These they are shewn how to reduce to Powder, &amp; with what water, i.e.
out of which river (or colord water if you please) the water is taken to mix up these Powders.
"With the roots &amp; herbs &amp;c. it is different&mdash;<u>they</u> <u>are</u> <u>boiled</u>" &amp;c.&mdash;These <u>stones</u> (for they are most
commonly thus denominated by them) are held in very great repute by them; tho' many of those that
have been shewn me as possessing wonderful virtues I considered as very common &amp; fool-
ish, or at least harmless things.  Here!  I am again digressing, which is everlastingly the case with
me when not in the <u>humor</u> of scribbling. I should have mentioned first (because as you
may see, I have begin <u>this</u> story in the <u>middle</u> instead at either of the two ends) that when they
want to dream of these things, as well as of any other particular thing, they must fast, &amp; lay
down to sleep, keeping their minds as free as possible from any other thoughts whatever,
&amp; wholly bent &amp; employed on that particular one alone. I also should have observed in
the proper place that the door the votary is introduced is exactly in the middle of
these rivers, there being 20 on each side of the door. The use, intent, &amp;c. &amp;c. of
the other 5 doors, I never thought to enquire, &amp; must leave you to guess as well as
myself 'till such times as I can get this matter explained. Their songs are
delivered in <u>Notes</u>, impressed or drawn on bark, in the form of hierlographics,
&amp; thus taught, &amp; being hierlographics (&amp; not very dissimilar to those anciently used by the
Egyptians; nay indeed, I have reason to think from what I have seen of both, that any
<u>Learned</u> man being perfectly acquainted with the one could trace a great deal in the other;
but this opinion I hazard from my own ignorance) no two are alike, it therefore requires

him to learn them; that is any <u>one</u> of them: for those notes are not like ours, <u>marked</u> with regular
bars &amp;c. so that one Gamut serves for all; but with them, each one may be said to be itself a <u>Gamut</u>.
However, I have reason to think that they are regular &amp; uniform; for many years ago, when
I was still scarcely more than a boy, I remember throwing away the contents of one these mede-
cine bags in which there were several strips of Bark covered with these Notes&mdash;
&mdash;an indian happened to be by&mdash;he took one up &amp; with the Point of his knife placing it on
one of these began to sing, moving the knife regularly as children do when they begin to learn
their a, b, c.&mdash;This surprised me a little at the time, for the indian was a stranger
&amp; had but lately arrived from his own lands that were several hundred miles off.&mdash;
After laughing at, &amp; ridiculing, him, as is the custom with us, I asked how he could
make them out? "The same said he, as you do to <u>reckon</u> (i.e. read) your <u>papers</u>
"See this one is (meant for) the <u>Thunder</u>; that, the Earth, &amp;c. &amp;c.; but I only
"know a few of these songs:&mdash;the possesser of this bag knew a great deal&mdash;he
"was a great Medecine man, i.e. Doctor" &amp;c. As far as I can learn, every different
root, herb, plant, mineral, Spirit (or whatever you may please to term this latter) have
each their respective songs; &amp; which they must sing, were  his voice like that of a choked
Pig, when he employs them for one of themselves, or learns them to another. When
they sing, those of their <u>familiars</u> who instructed this Song, whether to the one
who sings, as having learnt it from himself (i.e Familiar) or having been
handed to him; he is said to attend, invisibly of course,  &amp; perform that which he
promised this (medecine, supposing it is one) should effect. <b>[</b>This is a long &amp;
complex job, &amp; I doubt much if I can get  thro' with it without more of my blundering;
but I shall risk blunders, omissions, &amp; repetitions<b>]</b> Hence it is they always sing when
they attend on a desperately sick person, amongst themselves, tho very rarely when
they administer to the white. When any one is very sick, &amp; that they be <u>called</u> <u>upon</u>,
or perhaps, tho' rarely, ordered, in their dreams, by their Familiars, they sing, blow,
&amp; suck, alternately, &amp; with such violence that one would think they wanted to
to blow them to the d___l, or swallow them down their throats;  but no, it is to
force in the medecine, of which they have generally a mouthful, masticated into
a pulp. or something near <u>salve</u>, sometimes: the suction business is to draw out
the Devil; i.e the medicine, bone, stone, iron, brass, stick, or whatever they imagine
it is that occasions the disease. If the complaint lies in any particular part, to that
part it is they apply themselves most, &amp; sometimes <u>only</u>: supposing the hip, knee &amp;c.
for there they imagine it is a worm or maggot gnawing them. But if the complaint
is universal, that is the whole system be sick &amp; debilitated, it is then the pit of the Stomach
&amp; the Temples; rubbing sometimes the wrist, the palms of the hands. &amp; opposite the heart.
This is very frequently done, &amp; in the intervals the songs &amp; rattler together, &amp; often a

&amp; often a short speech or prayer to that one of their <u>Familiars</u> whom they think will be
most propitious on the occasion, or <u>he</u> from whom they hold such, or such instruction &amp;c.
These songs are a dull monotony; for tho' they have a few variations &amp; are hi &amp; low, &amp; the
transition sometimes so very sudden that it requires a particular command of the
throat to sing them;  &amp; to <u>me</u>, so difficult that I should I believe require a 7 years
apprenticeship even with Esculapius (but I believe it is <u>Pluto</u>, or <u>Pan</u> who teaches
the songs) himself, for me to learn them, there is certainly no musick in
them; tho' some few that I've heard many years ago, passing a winter with them,
I found pleasing enough; but perhaps more from the <u>solemnity</u> with which all
was going on was I struck, than any thing else: indeed we had had great reason to
be solemn, for we were dreadfully pinched by hunger. When oppressed thro' star-
vation, they have a variety of ceremonies which they perform;  &amp; tho' the songs be different,
as also the <u>ceremonies</u> themselves, still are they intended to answer the same purpose.&mdash;
I shall endeavour to describe a couple to you from which you may form a pritty
just idea of the rest.&mdash;It was the latter end of Jany. or beginning of Feby.  1804, four of
us only <u>white</u> people, mind  were pitching off, or rather flying off from our houses we had built in the fall on ac-
count of <u>the</u> enemies. We had a small stock of dry Provisions &amp; speared a few fish once or
twice, but there were so many of us that we were soon bro't to short commons as the
<u>strip</u> of country we were then going thru contained no other animals but a few strag-
ling Bears, but these animals at <u>this</u> season could not be found notwithstanding all the
exertions of our hunters. One evening on my return to our lodges one of the women told me that
the oldest man of our band, a great Doctor, or conjuror, as we frequently denominate them,
said that if I were to pay him half a carrot (1 1/2 lbs) tobacco, he would conjure &amp; be assured
of success, for it required payment. Tho' I suspected there was a trick in this, I did
not hesitate, but gave him his demand. The first night their songs &amp; ceremonies were
as usual. &mdash;"Tomorrow, my <u>familiar</u> tells me we shall get a Bear". All the hunters
returned at evening, <u>mais</u> <u>tous</u> <u>a</u> <u>blanc</u>. The second night, the rattler, songs, speeches,
smoking, &amp; medicine bags opened: "Tomorrow, we will assuredly get something." But the
same as the day before. The third night, the same, but every thing conducted with
a sort of awful silence &amp; solemnity that surprised me a good deal. I was harassed
with constant walking, weake thro' hunger, &amp; tired with their <u>Bêtises</u> as the
french say; but the manner of their conduct kept me that time from growling.
"Oh! Now tomorrow indeed, we shall not fail&mdash;we shall certainly eat flesh; for
the old man is a great conjuror, &amp; well liked: he prayed to the <u>master</u> or giver of <u>Life</u>, &amp; his
Dreamed have promised him success.  But we get no more than before.  In these conjuring
boutes&mdash;they made no use of drums, but instead of that had cut a small hollow tree of
maple, about 5 feet long &amp; scooped it out, after splitting so that it resembled a semicircle&mdash;

or stove pipe split down&mdash;this <u>hollow</u> board had been well dressed i.e. reduced to about half an inch in thick-
ness &amp; well polished: there were to the best of my memory four men seated taylor fashion &amp; held a
small stick about 3/4 ins. diameter &amp; about 15(ins.) long, in each hand: with these they beat time
to the tune &amp; another moved or shaked the rattler in the same manner. All this however was
to no purpose. There was another indian in company with us, but <u>tenting</u> by himself (&amp; his
family).&mdash;This indian who was very fond of me would frequently call me in &amp; give me a
share of what he had to eat: "Well! said he, what  success have your great men?"&mdash;I an-
swered I did not expect much: "No replied he, they did not go the right way to work,
"&mdash;had I not polluted (spoiled, as he said) my person last fall, alluding to an indian
"he had then killed, I should try; &amp; I beleive that my familiars would be <u>charitable</u>
"to me: however I shall let them go on 'till they are done, after which I shall make
"a trial: perhaps on <u>your</u> <u>accounts</u> they may shew me their wonted attention."
&mdash;I took this as wind, but as he spoke in so very <u>earnest</u> (si naivement) a manner, I con-
cealed my sentiments. The second night after the others had finished&mdash;he began a
little after dusk. But what a difference between them!&mdash;He had an immense large
drum, as large those among the military, &amp; stretched hard: upon this he beat time,
but very hard, to accord with his Songs which were as loud as he could bawl: at cer-
tain intervals also he used only his rattler,  but with as much violence as he could.
    Thus he continued alternately singing, praying (or making speeches) &amp; smoking,
'till broad day light. When he began, we thought this fellow was mad or only jesting;
but the indians of our lodge reproved us. At Sun rise he came out of his lodge,
&amp; made a long speech; in which he told one to go one way, a second another, &amp;
himself by another route. "Thou, addressing the first one, a young lad&mdash;thou wilt
"soon find thy (bear): but thou, addressing the father, on thy way on  thou wilt
"pass very near, but will not see him: Thou'lt search a long &amp; return giving up
"all hopes: but when come to this thou must return again &amp; between <u>this</u> thy last
"track &amp; the first one thou shalt make this morning, thou'lt see him in his
"nest. as for me, I shall have much trouble to get mine." I heard him
speake, but not understanding sufficiently the language, the women explained to me.
I need not tell you how <u>we</u> laughed at the poor Devil; &amp; so went off hunting <u>Ivy</u>
which had been our support for a long time; but in the evening we found all that
he predicted, perfectly verified. This I assure you is a fact, &amp; will maintain it
notwithstanding every thing <u>skeptics</u>, (excuse the term) or those unacquainted, or
but superficially so, with these people may say: &amp; I am also certain that he had no
previous knowledge of their being there; for there was plenty of snow, &amp; there were no other
tracks but those of these 2 hunters, &amp; we had pitched <u>up</u> (the river) that day. But, here
I am digressing: to return therefore.

&mdash;I am altogether out of the regular track that I had proposed to myself at my first setting
off; my time is to short, &amp; my memory to bad, to read over the whole, so as to resume the regular course
&mdash;the remainder shall be composed of <u>fugitive</u> <u>Pieces</u>. Indeed the nature of some of them being a
<u>compound</u> will not admit of their being <u>treated</u> of but in <u>sections</u> if I may use the term.
  The first therefore, lest I have not time to <u>enter</u> all, I shall speake of is
<b>The Soul!</b> This seems, to me, at least, a most extraordinary &amp; incomprehensible thing&mdash;
yet from the different sources which I have received it, &amp; the manner of relation serves but
more &amp; more to perplex. Whether it is really &amp; absolutely the soul, or some other <u>principle</u>
on which the very existence depends I cannot say, but something it is lodged appa-
rently in the Heart or breast, that on these occasions flies off &amp; leaves them; &amp; at the
very instant of its exit it is perceived, &amp; occasions such a derangement of the whole
system, &amp; particularly of the faculties as very soon to deprive the object of life; but
primally a total want of sense, such as we suppose the Soul <u>endows</u> us with.
  I shall here relate you one of the many stories of the kind verbatim as I received it.
  It was from an Indian of course. He told me that "one summer being on a visit
"rather to a distant part of the country (perhaps 2 or 300 miles) he fell in with one
"of his acquaintances, who (as often happens between strangers, particularly to
"such as come from the Southward) asked to purchase <u>medecines</u> of
"him. I had but a small quantity, &amp; only of  4 Sorts or kinds: he being
"very anxious for them, I sold them <u>all</u> to him: He was not satisfied&mdash;he must have more
"tho' I positively assured him I had given him the last. Then he menaced me, &amp; said
"I should feel the effects of his resentment arising from my avarice &amp; <u>uncharitable</u> spirit.
"Knowing his disposition, I returned to my friends, intending to be as far out of his
"way as Possible.  One night in the winter he conjured&mdash;I was fast
"asleep (&amp; several hundred miles off) &amp; never thought more of him: but he called upon
"his Familiars &amp; demanded my Soul(!)&mdash;<u>it</u> <u>was</u> <u>taken</u> to him; but just as it
"was on the eve of entering his conjuring hut I perceived it &amp; sprung from my bed
"in the most dreadful agonies &amp; convulsions insomuch that two men holding
"&amp; pulling of me with all their might, &amp; also had the assistance of the women,
"could not keep me quiet: I was constantly springing forward, rushing hither &amp;
"thither &amp; absolutely (i.e. totally) deprived of my faculties for I have not yet
"the least knowledge of what I was doing, so great was my horor in ob-
"serving this conjuring tent. At last a friendly spirit interfered &amp; forbad the
"conjuror at his peril to do any thing to my Soul, but allow it to return im-
"mediately. He was afraid for his own life &amp; durst not disobey&mdash;he let <u>it</u> go.
I cannot tell you how happy I was felt &amp; so easy&mdash;The distance was great indeed&mdash;
but I soon flew back &amp; re-entered my body; when I became entirely composed

"But I had been so dreadfully agitated that I found myself in a profuse sweat, my whole
"frame so shaken, debilitated, &amp; weake, that for several days I could not move but with pain.
"Heh! said I, what a narrow escape!&mdash;The other indians asked what ailed me? I told them
"where <u>I</u> had been&mdash;they would scarcely credit; but in the ensuing summer upon enquiry
"they found it true; &amp; were now fully convinced that this Power doth lodge with indi-
"ians"! They represent the soul as being small: not very dissimilar in size &amp; shape
from the yolk of a large Hen, or duck, Egg:&mdash;some of them very hard, &amp; much of the na-
ture &amp; substance of a stone, but still not of that substance; &amp; others again much more soft
&amp; tender: some are easily <u>kept</u> &amp; bruised, but others are with difficulty taken &amp; continually in motion;
but all are extremely impatient of restraint &amp; cannot bear it; &amp; confinement is death to the
body from which it has issued! Some conjurors possessing sufficient power, &amp; influence,
take a soul, if they want to destroy the body, (in the conjuring box or tent) &amp; wrapping it in
a piece of leather, rub &amp; bruise it between both hands 'till they destroy its subtility or
subtilty. As soon as it comes within view of the conjuring tent its agonies are ter-
rible as also those of the body, however distant that may be; but as soon as its motion is
destroyed the body dies likewise. Others again, take it &amp; put it in a Jappand Tobacco box, &amp; tie
the lid or cover securely tied with a <u>womans</u> <u>Garter</u>, from whence, if not loosened by someone it can
never escape&mdash;any other lashing is not, anything near, so completely effectual as this: reflect,
&amp; you will guess immediately the reasons they give. As I do not know latin, &amp; you dont
understand indian I must suppress this &amp; many other things. Others again take a different
method, thus: But by-the-bye, this has but very little relation to the Soul. I shall therefore
refer it 'till afterwards &amp; give you another Story as received from a Canadian an eye
witness. He was passing the winter with the indians &amp; one night the head man
of the tent he lodged in gave a feast. He was in the habit of doing it &amp; was himself ap-
parently a good &amp; peaceable man, but not to be trifled with by other indians. Every
thing being prepared the guests were just going to eat when the feast-man's mother
dropped suddenly as if dead: every one was struck with consternation: they had re-
course to their medicines, songs, rattlers &amp;c. as usual; at last he fell to sucking his
mother in one of her temples, suddenly they heard something <u>crack</u>: the indian
drew back, his mother arose perfectly recovered &amp; all became well. However that
which occasioned the <u>crack</u>, the indian took out of his mouth, wrapped carefully up &amp; gave
it to his wife to put in a tobacco box, which she did: it had all the appearances of a
<u>Bean</u> (un fêve)&mdash;the wife wanted to tie the lid but the husband said there was no
necessity&mdash;they resumed their meal. But the old woman was not long in possessi-
on of her senses. She very soon relapsed, &amp; as instantaneously as at the first "ho! exclaim-
"ed the indian, the <u>Dog</u> is off"&mdash;They looked into the tobacco box but nothing was found&mdash;They
continued conjuring 3 nights, &amp; the last especially, the man told me he thought the devil was

was amongst them from a certain kind of undescribable noise in the air, round about their tent,
&amp; the sudden flashings of light. This was Powder (Gun Powder): they had carefully thrown out
all the fire, thrown a great quantity of snow &amp; water on the hearth, &amp; then put fresh
Earth upon it&mdash;it was perfectly dark in the lodge, there being no other light than what is
usually emitted from the heavens: upon this hearth of fresh earth they would throw some
Powder &amp; then retiring to the bottom of the tent would say "come! let me see if I be a
"manito"&mdash;? then singing &amp;c. off the Powder would fly! They continued this way 3
nights but all to no purpose: the old woman yet lived 2 years but never spoke &amp;c.
He said (the indian) that this <u>bean</u> was "the Soul or Spirit of another indian, then at
a vast distance, which he darted at my mother to render her pitiful &amp; miserable;
but I shall make the Dog suffer." However , after this, the Canadian enquired why
he did not revenge himself &amp; kill him  "No; said he, that wont do: he has got back
"his soul it is true, &amp; I cannot get it again, yet I might easily kill him if I chuse,
"but this wont do&mdash;he is somewhat justifiable, for I took both his wives from
"him." There are many other instances of a like nature but different in the
proceedings, that I do not recollect sufficiently to commit to Paper.&mdash;
	Now again for the other way. If an indian has a spite against another, &amp; is
induced to it for the preservation of his own life, or from motives of revenge, he takes
the following plan or method. He takes a piece of leather &amp; cuts it into the shape
of his <u>enemy</u>; &amp; if he wants him to die speedily he places a little <u>Powdered</u> <u>medecine</u>
opposite the heart, or upon it. This medecine is I believe a root, &amp; very inflammable,
he holds a small spark of fire <u>near</u> it&mdash;it immediately <u>explodes</u> &amp; that part
of the leather on which <u>it</u> was becomes burnt &amp; shrivelled: when he performs this,
he generally utters words like these "Let the Heart of <u>such</u> <u>a</u> <u>one</u> become like this
Leather, let it shrivel &amp; die within him"! If it is a leg, an arm, the head,
or any other particular part, or parts, or even the whole body, it is the same, &amp;
the words also; unless he doth not wish for the death; then he will say "Let
"<u>such</u> <u>a</u> <u>part</u>, become lame, useless, ulcerous" &amp;c. &amp;c. according to his disposi-
tion; &amp; that part, or parts become thus affected according to his wish, "But
"how is it possible that such things can be?  Do you really think that an insig-
"nificant root, of no apparant power or virtue whatever can effect such things?"
Thus I would frequently question, &amp; their answers with little variations uni-
"versally the same." Yes, most certainly it is not the root alone, but with the assistance
"of that one of his Dreamed that is most powerful &amp; most fond of him: he! you white people
"you know not; you are consummately ignorant of the Power of our Great medecine men
"many things might I tell you much more surprising&mdash;but you do not believe these trifles,
"how much less then those  you do not know?"&mdash;What then is to be done! how do with

what say to a people so blind, so infatuated! They have some roots that are dreadful in their
effects&mdash;Being a female, I think I should prefer immediate death. They have some that have
the same effects as <u>Lunar</u> <u>Caustic</u>. They use them thus. During the time of their
"Seperation" (i.e menstruation) they endeavour to give them to smoke, which is never
refused&mdash;there is some of this root mixed with the Tobacco. Once smoking is sufficient
&mdash;a few months after their complexion begins to change&mdash;&amp; at last becomes of a
<u>nasty</u> black with abundance of hair growing out of the face; &amp; if these women
were to shave, I verily believe their beards would become as bushy &amp; thick as those of
any man whatever. In performing this, they must also utter words thus: "Let the
"one for whom I intend this, &amp; who shall smoke of it become black &amp; hairy; &amp; be-
"come as ugly &amp; rejected as she is now fair &amp; searched for"! Sometimes they
mingle it with their food or the liquor they drink: there is more than one kind of this
dreadful root; one of which I was shewn, but have forgotten, there being 2 or 3 others resembling
it.&mdash;it is like many others a perennial herb, &amp; hath some resemblance to the long or tall
Thistle. To return. When the subject, or object, discovers that she hath been thus dealt
with, which they sometimes do a few weeks after, they may be restored, for there is an
<u>antidote</u> to it; but I have never known one instance of this, tho' a dozen of the others I
have. Some handsome, fair complexioned young females refusing the importunate solli-
citations of an abandoned, vicious, revengeful wretch, becomes the victim of her
<u>coyness</u>; &amp; 2 or 3 years after, I have positively not known them &amp; could scarcely
beleive my Eyes.&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; There is of another kind &amp; which is very common,
whose effects is an extraordinary <u>vacuation</u> of blood, &amp; in a few days would occa-
sion death. A half breed I lately had with me, the Son of a man who many
years ago was a servant of yours, being not of an extraordinary good moral
character finding his sollicitations rejected with scorn became jealous &amp; very
anxious to revenge himself. He applied to an old indian, but in so cautious
a manner that the indian gave him of the root without suspecting &amp; told him
how to use it. He pulverised it, &amp; mingled it with a little vermillion &amp; then
watched his opportunity, which occurred I beleive, the ensuing morning. In our <u>out</u>-
Posts we have no temples dedicated to Cloacinda, &amp; besides, the females here are
ashamed to <u>sacrifice</u> at them: he therefore could not miss his opportunity&mdash;he wat-
ched, &amp; after she entered he went &amp; soon found the place by the <u>Smoke</u>: here he
sprinkled some of this Powder which he took in a quill, pronouncing "Let me see
blood issue from the same place <u>this</u> hath done&mdash;I want to see blood."&mdash;Scarcely
five hours after, the woman who was married &amp; of course so much the less bashful said
"what is the matter with me, I have been just now out &amp; want to go again." You may
suppose her astonishment seeing the time of the natural return was scarcely half elapsed

but how much more so finding it issue far beyond anything she had ever known: This con-
tinued 'til very late in the day &amp; the beast was watching to see if it would answer. He went
in to the house on pretence of a freindly visit, &amp; remarked how <u>Pale</u> she was&mdash;The mother
told him "my daughter has been <u>bewitched</u> &amp; could you not do something to ease her?"
He became extremely uneasy in his turn: he went out &amp; passing by the place she
went to he easily discovered notwithstanding her precaution of what dreadful conse-
quences it would be if not timely attended to. He was afraid she would die
before anything could be done. However he went to the old indian &amp; speaking in a
most sympathising strain, asked him if he could not administer something to stop
that extraordinary issue. "Why! replied the old fellow&mdash;That root I gave you the other
day is its own antidote&mdash;give her the length of her middle finger to <u>eat</u> &amp; it will
stop quick enough." He did not chuse to tell the indian that it was this that
had occasioned it lest he should be punished by him in his turn; but artfully con-
ducting his discourse got more from him, administered it to the woman, mutter-
ing in himself "Let this blood cease, I have seen enough of it"&mdash;&amp; she was soon
healed!  I done all I could to make him confess it, without coming to the point;
but he never would: he satisfied himself by assuring me with the most solemn
assererations that it was the case; "&amp; if you doubt it, continued he, you may
"make the experiment&mdash;you need be under no apprehensions whatever, for in
"giving her of the same root to <u>eat</u> it will stop." This root, when mastigated,
&amp; applied when reduced to pulp, but better when pulverised, stops the blood
immediately on application to any wound&mdash;"<u>how</u> <u>profusely</u> <u>soever</u> <u>it</u> <u>may</u>
"<u>flow</u>." It is very astringent, &amp; somewhat hot.
	Another herb, I beleive it is the (wild) Carroway, i. e. which we commonly denominate
aniseeds&mdash;at least the smell &amp; taste much resemble that, &amp; its stalk bears a very great resemblance
to the wild mint, as well as the leaves &amp; flowers. I <u>suppose</u> this is the one meant, because they tell
me the taste &amp; smell are delicious: This root, &amp; all its appurtenances (i.e. stalk, leaves, &amp; flowers)
is of  wonderful effects in various <u>things</u>. I shall give you some of the stories relating to it as I
received them. "I was living out with <u>such</u> an indian, &amp; we became reduced to <u>short</u> <u>commons</u>
"&mdash;One day he (the indian) took a piece of bark &amp; drew upon it 3 moose&mdash;&amp; put some of
"this <u>medecine</u> upon the heart &amp; head of each; then he fastened a piece of sinew to it &amp;
"told me to fasten it to a small stick that had been stuck <u>slant-way</u> in the Ground&mdash;
""Now said he, let me see if this will do: oh no! I am afraid it wont; but I'll try&mdash;if it
""answers, the bark will dance"! I laughed at his idea (a half breed told me this) &amp; so
"did one of his sons: however the son told me that he had seen his father do so before, &amp;
"that he killed every time"&mdash;stop! Let us see how he will go on," said the Son. The father
"began to sing (&amp; if <u>I</u> remember right, beat the drum also)&mdash;Shortly after the bark began to

"to move, &amp; as the old fellow raised his voice so did its motion increase, 'till at last it began
"whirling round with great violence, sometimes one way &amp; then another 'till it was wound
"up close to the stick, when it began changing sides&mdash;sometimes <u>upon</u> &amp; sometimes <u>below</u>
"the stick. He ceased: began to talk with us &amp; saying he was afraid it would not <u>answer</u>
"Thus he did 3 times, &amp; the bark moved every time with the same violence. Now he
"desired in the beginning that "if his <u>familiar</u> would have compassion on him, he would
"render these 3 moose foolish: that they might not be possessed of their usual cunning"&mdash;
"&amp;c.  The next day we went out&mdash;the old man, his son &amp; myself, a hunting&mdash;we
were hungry&mdash;We walked 'till late in the day &amp; finding no tracks I proposed our
return, but he told me we ought to proceed; 'for in the low ground beyond a
"small ridge then near in sight of us, we may perhaps find some tracks&mdash;
"I am never deceived when my I am answered' (i.e. my bark dances)&mdash;We soon
"reached this low Ground &amp; shortly after heard a noise: jumping, running &amp; breaking
"of Sticks 'ah! here they are,' said the old man: 'see how their <u>head</u> is turned!
"what a noise they make,&mdash;how they play&mdash;they are foolish. We killed them all."
"If you doubt me; ask any of the indians, &amp; see if they wont all tell you that <u>he</u> does so
when he wants to kill."&mdash;Another story: for <u>love</u> <u>potions</u>, or philters, are also com-
posed of this. "There were several young men (half-breeds) of us together &amp; also some
"young women, who came with us to await the arrival of their husbands from Fort
"William at <u>that</u> place. Two of our party wanted to pay them a <u>visit</u> in the
"night &amp; I endeavoured to dissuade them, but to no purpose:&mdash;they went, &amp; met
"with the reception I foretold: they began bawling out and on purpose to awake
"every one near &amp; shame us; for we were lodging by ourselves &amp; then took good
"cudgels &amp; pursued them into our place: <u>we</u> enjoyed this confusion of the others
"tho partly at our own expenses. One of them then addressed me  come Bpt. this <u>bitch</u>
"'has vexed me,&mdash;I know you have <u>good</u> <u>medicine</u>,&mdash;give me some of it that I may
"'laugh at her in my turn. (I must tell you that one of them I have known many
years back was, &amp; is still, a <u>bitch</u> i.e. according the indian acceptation  (as well as
well as our own,) of the term; &amp; the man is the same one I mentioned little above,
at the conclusion &amp; beginning of p.p. 30 &amp; 31) "I gave him some with the <u>directions</u> -
"&mdash;he returned again very soon after (in the same night)&mdash;found her asleep&mdash;he
"then rubbed her forehead, opposite her heart, the <u>pit</u> of the stomach, &amp; the palms
"of both hands. Then he awoke her. The next day, as my comrades were desi-
"rous of revenging themselves, they broached the conversation publicly &amp; had the laugh in
"their turn: the women had the <u>best</u> at the offset, but as they could not deny the other
"charges they became extremely confused &amp; vexed: a quarrel ensued; but my comrades exult-
"ingly told them 'we can turn &amp; twist you <u>now</u> about our fingers as we please.' And they

"they did too. For the women both <u>giving</u> <u>suck</u> at that time, thought it was their children
"that were handling them, as they used but <u>one</u> finger, &amp; gently." The other story is thus:
&mdash;A man that I have with me at present in consequence of some <u>slips</u> of his <u>Rib</u> had fre-
"quent, &amp; some severe quarrels with her&mdash;she began to hate him &amp; wanted to go with her
"<u>Par</u>-<u>amour</u>: the husband tho' vexed &amp; confused <u>did</u> <u>not</u> <u>want</u> to lose her: he began by
"soothing, coaxing, &amp; caressing her, but she always bawled out as loud as she could that
"every body might hear, tho' it were at midnight 'thou white dog, leave me alone
"'why art thou fumbling at me?" The more she became averse the more he coaxed
"&amp; she bawling out 'dont <u>slabber</u> me' every time he attempted to kiss her,&mdash;&amp;
"she was watching a fair opportunity to slip off to her lover (an indian). At last he lodged
"his complaints to me, &amp; asked if I could not <u>assist</u> him. I gave him some of this <u>mede</u>-
"cine with the usual directions &amp; told him as soon as he had executed all properly
"to come away &amp; leave her, &amp; not return to her for a couple of days so that in her
"turn she might suffer. He had not long left her 'till she called for him as if want-
"ing something &amp; like a Goose he went immediately, tho' I done all I could to make
"him pay her in her own coin.&mdash;Since that time they live as you see them.
"<u>But</u> if you doubt of this also, you can easily make the experiment&mdash;chuse any
"one you please, &amp; let her be ever so coy, &amp; shy, you will bring her as you want"!!!
&mdash;Shortly after this I made some general enquiries of the man latterly in question,
but he would not avow, tho' from his confusion &amp; precipitancy with which he an-
swered, I beleive there is <u>something</u> in the business. "It is with this medecine con-
"tinued the half breed, that the young men do completely &amp; universally succeed
"with all the women that please them." With this also, principally, they
succeed in bewitching any one they are averse to, &amp; prevent them from killing such
animals as they please. They draw the likeness of the animal or animals, they do
not chuse the others to kill, put of this medicine (tho' most commonly mixed with
some others in this latter case) upon the hearts &amp; desire that they may become shy
&amp; fly off upon any the least appearance or approach of them. Or, they will <u>conjure</u>
&amp; desire some of their <u>familiars</u>, one, or several, to <u>haunt</u> <u>such</u> <u>a</u> <u>one</u> in all his
motions &amp; scare &amp; frighten off, &amp; <u>render</u> <u>wise</u> any <u>such</u> &amp; <u>such</u> animals; &amp; let
the distance be hundreds of miles off&mdash;their familiars that are spirits residing
in the air, &amp; transport themselves in an instant to any place they place, &amp; who see all
that is going on <u>below</u>, keep <u>all</u> away accordingly. To evade this is a task that but
few can succeed in. They must first Conjure to learn who it is that has bewitched them,
then they inquire what is to be done: but here lies the difficulty.&mdash;Sometimes they are
told they <u>must</u> leave the appointed time run out: at others, such &amp; such ceremonies, which is
tantamount to the first answer; but at others again, it is easily dispelled&mdash;This depends

depends entirely upon the precautions the <u>bewitcher</u> has taken, the Power, influence, or number
of his Dreamed: as also on the other hand of the Dreamed, their, power, influence &amp;c. of the <u>be</u>-
<u>witched</u>. But sometimes on a very slight or trivial cause depends the whole.&mdash; &mdash;
  I shall tell you another story. An old Canadian I have now with me has been in the
habit of <u>living</u>-<u>free</u> for many years back. In the beginning of a winter he was
tenting with some indians, &amp; one of them an impertinent, bombastic sort of character
was boasting to him of the great power &amp; effect of some medicines &amp; a drum he had
lately received from a Sauteux &amp;c. &amp;c. "for some time I did not mind him, but
"finding he became at last troublesome, &amp; insinuating as plainly as he durst that
"<u>he</u> was now invulnerable, or rather immortal &amp; that <u>we</u> were helpless, a quarrel
"ensued 'till at last I fxxt. upon your medicines &amp; drum &amp; the one also who gave
"them to you said I. We seperated in no good freindship. At night he mad a feast &amp;
"invited me amongst the rest with the design of poisoning me; but his freinds remonstrated so ef-
"fectually that he put this off &amp; intended shooting me going out of the lodge; but this also
"the others would not allow: he was vexed&mdash;I kept my eye upon him, determined I should
"give the first blow on the least motion he might make. Finding himself prevented
"in these he said that I indeed should kill 2 moose, but that the rest of the year I
"should starve as a dog. I seperated next day with my wife &amp; children&mdash;they were
"under great apprehensions, but I mocked all their conjurings&mdash;I very shortly
"killed 2 moose; but these indeed were the last. I walked &amp; hunted every day&mdash;
"&amp; seldom one day passed but I fired at the Buffaloe, moose, or some other animal,
"but never got anything anything&mdash;I &amp; my family were near dying with hunger, I
"tried every thing in my power, never giving myself the least trouble about the indians
"menaces.  At last the spring arrived&mdash;Ducks &amp; Geese came; but no better suc-
"ess. At last one day prowling in my Canoe I met 2 other <u>free</u>-<u>men</u>, who, after mutual
"inquiries &amp;c. told me "the same thing had happened him &amp; that an indian told him to file
"off a small piece of the <u>muzzle</u> of his Gun &amp; wash it well with water in which <u>Sweet</u>-
"<u>flag</u> had been boiled, &amp; killed after that as before."  I laughed at the idea, but re-
"flecting that it was an innocent experiment &amp; I could not offend the almighty, I
"tried, &amp; the first animals I saw I immediately killed.&mdash;This Sir, continued
"he, I assure you is a positive fact"!!!&mdash;I find that the indians have recourse
to this method also. But you must observe: as is the disease::so is the remedy. Another story just
now occurs to me which I shall relate, not so much to multiply these pretended
proofs as to shew that our Iroquois, Algonquins &amp;c. &amp;c. are not such complete converts
to the Christian faith as most people may complacently imagine, but rather have
a mongrel religion like those whom the King of Babylon sent to inhabit Samaria
when he carried Reuben &amp; Ephraim captives (In the Bible). This winter an Iroquois

told me that one winter he was out a Beaver hunting with many of his friends.&mdash;The
oldest man of their party proposed one day that a certain number of them should go out a
hunting Moose or Buffaloe, &amp; the others Beaver. This one says "I returned at night after
"a good success&mdash;the old man nothing&mdash;he became envious&mdash;a quarrel ensued; &amp; after
"this many others. One day I fired at a moose as he was running past me, he fell&mdash;I
"went to him; &amp; just as I was for beginning to skin he rose up, but with my
"axe I bro't him down&mdash;it was very far from home&mdash;I merely opened him &amp;
"returned light, trusting to the others of our party; for I had no desire of partaking of the dry
"provisions the old fellow had, of his own.  Imediately on entering the lodge we had a-
"nother severe quarrel, &amp; he told me I should not any more exult in my prowess
"as he should take care I should not kill any more animals for <u>some</u> <u>time</u>. As we
"were coming to <u>knife</u> <u>work</u>, I ordered my wife to bundle up all our things &amp; my
"lodge, &amp; pitch off&mdash;it was then late, &amp; I had not yet eaten. As none of my
"friends knew that I had killed, I did not chuse to tell them, but merely said
"as I was going off  'Let those who are fond of me, or who chuse, follow me'; but none came,
"&amp; I encamped upon my moose. Every day I went a hunting&mdash;scarcely a week
"passed but I fired 20, 30, &amp; sometimes upward of 50 Shot, upon Buffaloe or Moose,
"but could never kill&mdash;I would <u>miss</u>, or <u>the</u> <u>ball</u> <u>twisting</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>hair</u> <u>would</u>
"<u>fall</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>animal</u> without doing further injury. I starved for a long time&mdash;
"&amp; became so weake that I could hardly walk. At last my wife (a woman of
"this country) one day that I had been out as usual had prepared some good
"strong lye, &amp; on my return washed my Gun with it; filled it, &amp; stopping
"both the orifices put it over the smoke where it remained all night. She
"also took a number of the balls &amp; boiled them likewise in the lye, telling me she had
"seen her uncle do so many years before when he too had been bewitched.&mdash;I thought at
"all events it could do no harm; &amp; besides I could have done anything, I was so hungry.&mdash;
"The next day I went out again,&mdash;found another flock or herd of near 20 Buffaloe,
"I drew nigh &amp; took all my usual precautions&mdash;I fired, one dropped; fired again,
"another dropped:&mdash;I  killed 14 out of that herd; &amp; ever after missed not once"!
I asked him how the old fellow had done?-- he said "I suppose it was as they
"frequently do&mdash;i.e. bury a piece of my meat in the Ground &amp; pray the Devil
"to prevent my killing: for the Iroquois, when they take it in their head,
"are very wicked, &amp; do not want power"!&mdash;A few days ago a half-breed, abandoned
with the indians, came in; &amp; amongst his other  <u>wantages</u> asked me for a small piece of (red) <u>sealing</u>-
wax "because my brother cannot draw blood from the animals he fires at: by heating his Gun &amp; ap-
"plying this wax the blood will flow profusely from the wounds". He expressed himself afraid that
his brother might have been bewitched &amp; by retarding this operation he might enter <u>dans</u> <u>sa</u> <u>mal</u> <u>chance</u>!"

These few <u>examples</u> will suffice to shew you that they have different methods of <u>bewitching</u>
&amp; also different ways of clearing themselves.  And the faith, &amp; dread, they have of this, is scarcely
credible; &amp; the consequences are often too uncommonly distressing.&mdash;I shall now give you of the
    <b>Story of the Hairy Breasts</b>.  Near the days of <b><u>Noah</u></b>, nations were few &amp; small.
<b>Weesuckajock</b> (noah, I shall call him for abbreviation sake) had a son as I told you before
whose name was Nay-hân-nee-mis. Being straitned for provisions he went out to angle
with some of the Hairy-Breasts. They came to a Lake, pierced several holes, but the
North (or North wind, as you chuse) being envious of Nayhanemis, froze the water down
to the very ground; so that in the deepest parts they found but Earth &amp; after much
digging at last reached the bottom; but behold that also was frozen! &amp; who knows
to what depth in the Earth? Finding this to be the case Nay<u>s</u>, addressed his freinds
thus&mdash;"I see this is the doings of the N. Wind (now by rights the N. Wind ought to have been his
maternal Gnd Father&mdash;but what cannot envy do?) "he is envious of us, &amp; wants to make
"us die of hunger&mdash;but he shall not!&mdash;I have to propose to you to cut off my head&mdash;rip
"up my body, beginning at the throat&mdash;You must not hurt nor break any single
"one of my bones; but carefully take off all the flesh, dry it, &amp; make Pounded meat of it.
"of this you must sprinkle a little in every one of the holes; you must also <u>chop</u> up
"my Heart into very small pieces &amp; throw a few of these pieces also into each hole: then put in
"your lines, &amp; you'll take as many fish as you please. But my bones you must put in a
"heap, carefully by themselves. Mind! upon your faithful observance of all these commands
"depends our mutual safety. The North thinks himself sole master, &amp; would wish to
"crush us because we begin to have a little knowledge: but he shall know me!"
They done accordingly, &amp; accordingly also they took abundance of fish. North per-
ceived this: he came to see, &amp; finding himself thus frustrated inquired how it came
about?&mdash;they told: He challenged Nay<u>s</u>. who by this time had revived; &amp; besides
a beautiful large feather he had sticking in his cap or head, which none durst wear
but such as have given incontestible proofs of their Manhood, bravery &amp;c. he like-
wise had a smoking bag, of the Skin of a badger. Nayhanimis accepted the
challenge. "It seems Nahanimis you are a great man, a man of extraordinary power &amp; abilities!&mdash;
"&mdash;let us have a trial, &amp; see which of us has the most; for I also have some Knowledge"&mdash;Nahani-
mis answered "No! I have but little power, but that little I employ as much as I can
"to the General benefit of my fellows: let us see what you can do, which if I cannot,
then you will certainly be superior to me." Here they performed one or two wonderful feats
but in which Nayhanimis had the advantage most confessedly.&mdash;The North pierced his body
through, &amp; done another extraordinary thing I cannot well recollect; but the other done more
&amp; recovered not only more suddenly but more perfectly. At last the North put a bet &amp; said "Let
"us see for this last act: I will cut off my head &amp; if I cannot replace &amp; recover perfectly

"perfectly, the same as I am at present, then my <u>house</u> &amp; all I have shall be yours; but if I succeed,
"&amp; you cannot, then all your <u>possessions</u> shall be mine." Nayhanimis consented; for he was
secretly desirous of humiliating the selfsufficient spirit of North. They tried&mdash;North failed,
but Nayhanimis completely succeeded: He deliberately severed his head from his body, put it
down on the Ground beside him, very composedly, &amp; then replaced it, when it be-
came as tho' nothing had happened. But this was owing to the Power &amp; virtue of
his <u>Plume</u>; which, however, the others knew nothing off. It appears that the North also
recovered but by the assistance of his friends, of whom he had a numerous train. North
was faithful to his promise&mdash;Gave him his house which was beautiful &amp; spacious,
but mostly underground, or at least in the side of a mountain. All his freinds
turned out, put in Nayhanimis &amp; gave him the full possession. But he was no sooner in than
they secured all the outlets; doors, windows &amp;c. &amp; set it on fire to destroy one whom they
found so much more powerful than themselves!  Nay<u>s</u>. finding this to be the case was
not in the least dismayed, but took his smoking bag &amp; thus addressed it "Now <u>thou</u>
"Badger,&mdash;our mutual safety depends upon thy obedience &amp; expedition&mdash;Thou
"art made to pass <u>thro'</u> the Earth as <u>quick</u> as <u>upon</u> it: these fools think to destroy
"us, but thou must shew that we are superior to them." During the conflagration they were
enjoying the scene &amp; exulting in the idea of having at last succeeded in destroying so formidable
an adversary: but what was their consternation when they saw him come to them without
even one hair of his head singed!&mdash;they were <u>appalled</u> with astonishment &amp; had not
the power of utterance. At last recovering a little they endeavoured to pass it off as a
joke &amp; turn it to his own advantage, by silencing at one blow the envy &amp; malice of his <u>all</u>
enemies, pretending to be a staunch friend of his. But he was not thus to be duped; yet
he shewed a superiority of sentiment &amp; generosity equal to his Powers &amp; abilities by
giving them (tho' <u>contemptuous</u> if you please) pardon.  So much for this <u>Part</u>.&mdash;
    Thus did matters pass on for yet a few years. "The <u>indians</u> began to <u>multiply</u> &amp; inha-
bit the world: but the Hairy-breasts, a jealous, envious, and at best foolish people,
could not well behold <u>their</u> prosperity: they made <u>war</u> upon them (the <u>indians</u>) by
stealth &amp; destroyed numbers: their affairs bore a most dismal aspect&mdash;no less than the
total extinction of the whole race. At last Nayhanimis pitched off with his wife,
<u>her</u> <u>father</u>, &amp; another one&mdash;there were four of them. He found found a Beaver lodge&mdash;
here some of the <u>Hairy</u>-<u>Breasts</u> came up with him. Compliments at first, afterwards
Sneers, taunts &amp; revilings; but so ambiguously that no hold could be taken. "How nume-
"rous: how many are there of ye" inquired the Hairy B. "We are twenty of us" replied
Nayhanimis; "&amp; so are we rejoined the others. Now, they here entered into an arrangement that
whoever found <u>Beaver</u> for the future it should be his own; but to avoid any wrangles, he who <u>found</u>
the Beaver should plant a stick or branch upon the lodge, as a mark. On their return

home each recounted to his family what he had met with in the course of the day. "Now said <u>Nay</u>-
"<u>hanimis</u>, addressing his family, we must take 20 Beavers, one for each man of  them (meaning the
"hairy-breasts) &amp; make a feast. If it turns out that we be able to eat these 20 Beaver, &amp; they
"not, then we shall be superior to them &amp; have the upper hand." The Beaver were cooked
accordingly:&mdash;he took his <u>rattler</u> which he shook to the tunes of his Songs,&mdash;performed the
usual ceremonies, &amp; they eat the whole 20 B. with ease. Then addressing his family
thus, said "These Hairy-Breasts are great boasters, but cowards&mdash;They are a people of
no account&mdash;tomorrow will decide all." The Hairy Breasts on their return did
the same as Nayhanimis &amp; cooked also 20 B. thinking that his band did really con-
sist of that number. They eat: but every one was already full &amp; yet more than 3/4
of the feast  remained&mdash;"Give me my rattler (said one of the oldest) that I sing &amp;c. it may
"happen that we find grace". He sang &amp; shook his rattler, but it would not sound&mdash;
After frequent repeated trials to no effect he became vexed &amp; threw it out of doors
among the Dogs "This dog of a rattler will not sound in spite of all my endeavours: but
"hold! hear how it rattles now that it is out&mdash;go for it one of ye, perhaps it was
"owing to some fault in me." They bro't it to him: but still as before: he threw
it out again in a rage; it was no sooner out than it sounded well as before:
it was bro't in again: but as before again. Then he threw it out for good, vexed
&amp; disappointed to the utmost degree. But his freinds were not pleased; they considered
this a portentious omen &amp; his behavior foolish; &amp; by no means calculated to reconcile their <u>Deities</u>
to them. He comforted them by telling them the numbers of "the adverse party must be few,
"otherwise we had surely been able to <u>eat</u> the whole of this feast: they are few &amp; we <u>shall</u> sub-
"due them." The next day they all pitched off. Nayhanimis came first to a Beaver
lodge &amp; marked it&mdash;came another &amp; marked that one also. But making a circuit, in
which he hung up his Bow, quiver &amp;c. &amp;c. in a tree, at his own height, came round
to the same lodges &amp; found that the Hairy-B had put marks of their own  &amp; thrown
his one away:&mdash;exasperated he threw theirs away &amp; replaced his, &amp; made another
circuit, when he found the H.B. had replaced their own again: He also
remarked that the HB. had hung up their Bows &amp;c. &amp;c. <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>tops</u> <u>of</u> <u>very</u> <u>hi</u> <u>trees</u>, trusting
to their numbers. At last they met&mdash;greeted each other at first, then sneers, quarrels,
a challenge &amp; then the battle: they were to fight <u>man</u> <u>to</u> <u>man</u>&mdash;Nayhanimis killed 19
right out, but the 20th had near killed him: however this was but an accident
usual in battles&mdash;he soon killed him also. The women were coming up when raising
his voice to a pitch to be distinctly heard by heard by all said "Such of ye <u>indian</u>
"women as have been taken from your homes, had your husbands killed &amp;c. such
"of ye indian women as are willing to return to your nation, take all axes &amp; others
"arms out of the hands of these H. B. women,&mdash;seperate yourselves from them; attack

"&amp; destroy them <u>all</u>: leave not one alive to carry the news to the others. They seperated accordingly &amp;
killed every soul. Then he took them to his tent &amp; finding by their answers to his queries
that there were still another band not far off consisting of 40 young &amp; 2 old men of the HB.
he ordered a quantity of poles or pickets to be cut very long &amp; made a kind of Fort of
them round his own tent:&mdash;gave orders to them to gather a vast quantity of snow
round all the sides of it, to come over the points, so  that neither the pickets nor
tent might be seen, &amp; that this rising might have the appearance of a natural
hill, something in short in the form of a pit. He immediately made a
number of lances &amp; spears &amp; walked off in quest of his enemies. He soon reached
their camp&mdash;drew near &amp; found that there were but 2 old men, all the others were
out a hunting. Here he listened to their conversation &amp; was burning with indignation
at the stories these 2 old men told each other of the cruelties they had done to
the <u>Indians</u>&mdash;They were chukling at this when he sprung into the tent, took each
by the head &amp; thrust their faces in the fire &amp; sprang out again to listen. One
of them returning to his senses, for they had both fainted during the ceremony, exclaimed thus "my
"old freind! what is the matter with me? I lost my senses quite suddenly &amp; now
"that I am come to, I feel my face quite sore &amp; cannot see"&mdash;"It is the same with me"
replied the other one&mdash;"Then it must be some evil spirit that has pounced upon us"
resumed the first. At last Nayhanimis addressed them thus "I shall tell ye old men a story too.
"There were two old men formerly seated in their tents relating to each other the exploits
"of their younger days &amp; the cruelties they committed upon the <u>Indians</u>&mdash;Nayha-
"nimis was near&mdash;he pounced upon them &amp; thrust both their heads together
"into the fire. When your children &amp; young men be returned from their hunting
"tell them this Story, in the mean time I shall return home &amp; make ready for them&mdash;
"&mdash;my name is <u>Nayhanimis</u> &amp; I reside at <u>such</u> a <u>place</u>" (i.e. I am <u>called</u> (or
named) Nayhanimis &amp;c.). The old men as may be imagined, were Thunder Struck with this &amp; durst
not say a word more. But in the Evening the young men came home&mdash;They were astonished to see
their fathers in such a plight. "Children! behold your fathers! said they&mdash;Had any <u>miscreant</u>
"durst act in such a manner to <u>our</u> fathers, their villanny should certainly not have
"passed off thus: <u>but</u> <u>we</u> <u>are</u> <u>now</u> <u>old</u> <u>men</u> <u>&amp; of</u> <u>no</u> <u>more</u> <u>account</u>!!!" This last apostrophe
above all the rest roused them to vengeance: they merely scraped the snow off their feet
&amp;legs &amp; went immediately in quest of him, vowing vengeance all the way of a most cruel &amp; <u>ex</u>-
<u>emplary</u> nature. Nayhanimis was on his guard, every soul able to weild a weapon had one in
his hand, besides an infinite number of spears &amp; sharp stakes stuck in the Ground, The H.
B. came, but not perceiving the trap on account of the snow that was bro't over ends of the
stockades they all fell in one upon the other &amp; impaled themselves in their fall on those sticks &amp;c.&mdash;
All of them but 2 or 3 met with instantaneous death&mdash;The few that were not injured were put to

to an excruciating, but immediate death to satisfy the <u>manes</u> of the departed <u>indians</u>; &amp; he proceeded im-
mediately to the Camp; killed the remaining 2 old men, scoffing &amp; taunting them at the same
time. Immediately after this he ordered such of the <u>indian</u> women as had had their hus-
bands killed, or were taken by the H. B. to seperate from the other women &amp; inflict the same
punishment upon them &amp; their children as had been done to their friends. "Thus were
"the Hairy Breasts entirely exterpated, merely by their own folly &amp; wickedness. Had they lived
"peaceably, &amp; allowed the <u>indians</u> to partake of the blessings of this world without envy,
"as well as themselves, &amp; to which they had an undoubted right, they might still have
"been in existence. However there are still 2 nations of them, one of which is on <u>Your</u>
"Lands, the others, I believe beyond the Seas: but they are an insignificant &amp; most
"despicable people. They pretend to antiquity &amp; would fain extort respect from the
"<u>moderns</u> (i.e. themselves, or the indians, <u>principally</u>) but their very countenance, appearance,
"every thing about them denotes folly &amp; seems more to demand contempt than to call for
"respect. I saw one many years back, who was bro't by the Traders from somewheres
"on your Lands:  he face was venerable, but still there was a meanness in the <u>whole</u> of
"him that I could not account for: I respected him, &amp; wanted to treat him according-
"ly&mdash;this is as from the Stories I had heard related of them; but the Traders laughed
"at <u>us</u> &amp; asked one if I was inclined to respect folly, insignificance, &amp; nothing"!!!&mdash;
    I have been a long time in writing these Pages &amp; have been frequently disturbed&mdash;I have been
often obliged to put by my paper after seating myself 5 or 6 times to write only one word: from such
long &amp; frequent interruptions <u>much</u> method &amp; correctness cannot be expected&mdash;I therefore send
them to you in the form of <u>Notes</u>. My motives for thus employing my time &amp; paper were
first to amuse &amp; instruct myself, but principally for your own amusement &amp; such few

let too many see them; for I have some notion please God I live to digest them into
form &amp; regularity &amp; have them published, besides a vast many others I purpose with
Gods help, collecting: but this is merely between ourselves &amp; immediately after perusal
blot out all <b><u>this</u></b> Paragraph. Journals, voyages &amp;c. &amp;c. of these people have been fre-
quently published: but I have met with none that gives so circumstantial a
detail of their private life (if I may so say) as is necessary to give that insight to
their ideas &amp; notions (&amp; this latter term too, I think, critically speaking cannot be appli-
cable to them) that is required &amp; so much wanted to form a proper estimate of
man in his <u>natural</u> state.  We all see them, hear them &amp; relate of them; but where is
there one who can give the <u>why's</u> &amp; <u>wherefore's</u> that these people do so, &amp; so?  I beg you will
<u>blot</u> this last paragraph entirely out, at least the first part; &amp; do not be premature in
your condemnation or judgement of me, for I trust my motives are entirely destitute of
vanity &amp; only the desire of truth urges me, or at least true &amp; just information &amp;c. &amp;c. G N.

	Such are the notions &amp; ideas of these people. They acknowledge a superior Power, not Wee-Suck-a-
-jock, as I was erroneously informed "but the same <u>one</u> you adore in the Christmas holidays". This
one they have a great respect &amp; veneration for but seldom it is as far as I can learn) that they sa-
crifice or pray to him i.e. make speeches, which tho' extempore, <u>I</u> consider as much prayers as tho'
they were composed after the most deliberate &amp; mature reflection; &amp; many parts of them so simple,
plain, natural, &amp; withal so sublime that I frequently felt great pleasure in attending to them.
    But these sentiments are so few comparitively speaking, &amp; the absurdities so great &amp; frequent that
few men can hear them without lamenting their ignorance. They have often seemed to me
as desirous in a hi degree of becoming acquainted with the true <u>mode</u> of worshipping, from
the frequent changes, even during my time, they have made in their <u>worshippings</u>. As a proof of this
is the avidity with which they seize any new system introduced from their <u>Southern</u> neigh-
bors: the short time they hold it; &amp; how completely it is abandoned, if not entirely forgotten
for another, equally if not more absurd than the former. To introduce a new system
among them it is only necessary to report an extravagant tale of some wonderful character,
&mdash;the cures by <u>this</u> means that have been performed &amp; such like miraculous &amp; fantastic
nonsense. But in their fundamental points I perceive no visible alteration. The prin-
cipal of these is what they call the Mee-tay-wee. A ceremony I shall compare
to Free-masonry; but the initiations are public&mdash;every one that chuses comes to see
them &amp; many are invited. Here, in the course of initiation are ceremonies or deviltries
performed that no man of his own mere dexterity or Power <u>can</u> do. The next
principal one is conjuring. This is a principle I believe as natural to man as the air he
breathes (tho' not <u>so</u> necessary). Every one wishes to peep into futurity &amp; there are few but
who would not inquire into causes could they do it, or were it not forbidden them. Thes two
of course are consequences or consequents of their mythology. There are many in the
civilized or Christian world who absolutely &amp; positively deny this power of theirs as being
absolutely impossible &amp; at best but absurd &amp; idle stories. Many of the things related of
these Conjurings I acknowledge to be so; but at the same time I am as positive &amp; as
firmly persuaded of the truth of the assertion "that they have dealings with some supernatural
spirit," as I am convinced that I live &amp; breathe in air; unless, indeed, we chuse to acknow-
ledge &amp; believe a certain sect of Philosophers (of the last century I beleive) who <u>wish</u> to tell
us that we <u>only</u> <u>imagine</u> <u>ourselves</u> <u>alive</u>. And I am by no means inclined to acknowledge
myself as superstitious: I am convinced of this from reason, argument, comparison; in-
-short from <u>analysis</u>. Let any one man, unless he be a headstrong brute who is <u>de</u>-
<u>termined</u> before hand not to be convinced, analyse their <u>discourses</u> &amp;c. &amp;c. and I am confi-
dent he will beleive as much as many, or have great doubts at least. To absolutely
deny this, we must first deny that there is a Devil, &amp; afterwards deny his pernicious power

and if we deny these points, we must descend to a third, &amp; more fit for an atheistical wretch
&amp; a beast than a Christian, or even rational creature. I have heard some sensible &amp; well informed
Gentleman deny it on the plea of their <u>ignorance</u>; but this again is <u>a</u> basis &amp; very
solid one. These people are still in a complete state of nature: their ideas of the true
God are far from clear or correct: they acknowledge him indeed as the Supreme &amp; absolute Master of
all, but more or rather as a passive <u>Deity</u> than as he really is; but their notions of their other
Deities come far more near the truth. Their wants indeed are also few, but they are arbitrary
&amp; cannot be dispensed with, at least for any time; it is therefore very natural that they should em-
ploy their whole thoughts &amp; most of their time in procuring these means to warding off or averting their dangers.
And I do not know of any method more adapted to this than the one they pursue, i. e.
Fasting &amp; Sleeping to dream; &amp; they do dream too: &amp; many of these dreams are so complicated,
or compounded of so many different things that it is absolutely beyond the power of <u>their</u> in-
vention to fabricate them. Surely a man man beleive his senses.  A man tied, wound up in
a blanket, or skin equally soft: here he is held by one, two, or 3 men&mdash;he slips out of the
blanket &amp; presents himself before you free, leaving the cords &amp;c. <b><u>untied</u> </b>in the blanket: you
hear him Speak, &amp; perhaps 20 other voices besides, all at the same: again he is bound as a
criminal, rather indeed as a Pig, crumpled into a heap &amp; thrust in to his <u>hut</u>&mdash;at the
very instant of his entrance the hut shakes as if ten thousand devils were for pulling it
to pieces: you enter this, find the man absent, hear a fluttering about your ears, or see
a vast number of small lights resting on the hoops that hold the poles together:
immediately after you are out you hear the man speake within again; you look again &amp; feel
for him, but hear him talking at a distance; What can this be but supernatural
agency?&mdash;I have never seen feats of <u>this</u> kind, but others I have, not so <u>strong</u>, but equally con-
vincing. I have been informed that a young half-breed, abandoned with the indians almost
from his childhood, a few years back entered one of these conjuring <u>huts</u> at the solicitation
of one of the N. W. Gentlemen to see what retarded the people so long. Previous to his entering a great
deal of conversation on the subject had been: matters were settled between them &amp; the con-
juror. Some time after his entrance he began to cry (not weep) as a person uneasy,
at first the voice was within, but it appeared as rising in the air, &amp; at last was lost.
"Well!" said one of the indians addressing one of the half-breeds, living with the white "Well! enter
"now, &amp; see if he be there: thou art always doubting &amp; denying what we say of these things:
"enter then &amp; see if he be there, then indeed are our assertions false." He raised the bottom
of the <u>casement</u> &amp; entered, but as he was not below, he rose on his feet &amp; felt for him, but
not to be found. However he was <u>paid</u> for his curiosity: there was a dreadful flutter-
ing within, but especially about his head, his hair flying about in  his face as if in
a tempest &amp; frequent appearances of small lights before his eyes which ever way he turned: he
bawled out &amp; asked those without what was the matter with him: he became afraid &amp; <u>walkd</u>

out as quick as he could. Very shortly after they heard the same cries of pain, faintly, at first, but
the voice soon entered. The <u>Conjuror</u> said he was carried to where the people were "They are all
aslepp, at such a place &amp; tomorrow will be here" &amp;c. He said there were 4 (spirits) of them,
that carried him off: Each held him by the <u>little</u> <u>finger</u> <u>&amp; little</u> <u>toe</u>! I shall here relate
a couple more of these stories. And indian told me that several years back he left his lodge
on the borders of a large Lake to go to the house for some necessaries he wanted. He took
a traverse for some islands,&mdash;the weather was dull but mild: a storm very soon set in&mdash;
but he persevered: thinking the wind had changed, he also changed his course. He became
very much fatigued &amp; laid down on the ice to rest himself &amp; wait for day light, for
<u>the</u> night had overtaken him. He was not long down before reflecting on his situation
he became extremely uneasy &amp; was afraid of freezing. At last he heard a curious noise near
him that he could not account for: at first his fears increased greatly dreading it was
some malignant spirit; but having no alternative he resigned himself to his fate "&amp; I became
"as composed as tho' I were safe; &amp; I was too: for an animal much resembling a Wolf
"&amp; black, came up &amp; covered me; I was very cold, shivering in every limb, but I soon
"became quite warm: he rose from off me &amp; went on as if inviting me to follow&mdash;his
"eyes appeared like 2 candles.&mdash;I followed&mdash;he led me to an island where I made a fire
"&amp; warmed &amp; dried myself; &amp; as soon as I was rigged I followed him, for he went off &amp; looked at
"me so earnestly I took it for an order: he led me straight to the water hole:&mdash;
"there happened to be people at the time there going for water&mdash;They saw <u>these</u> lights
"&amp; asked me what occasioned them, or who it was that came with me,&mdash;I told
"them it was a compassionate spirit that retrieved me from a dreadful death."&mdash;
&mdash;<b>2<u>nd</u>!</b> A young man lately told me the following "I was returning home with my
"uncle when come to <u>that</u> point we heard something crying behind us he! he! ha! ha!
"&amp; whistling alternatively.  My uncle told me it was a Pah-Kack (Skeleton) &amp; wanted to
"destroy us. It came up with us very soon &amp; kept constantly buzzing &amp; whistling in our
"ears so that indeed we were quite bewildered at last: it was at night &amp; dark, but
"we kept strait on as we thought; we were mistaken, for after
"walking a long time, we at last came to the water hole again from where we had
"set off.  We were both of much afraid; but finding this path we minded it no
"more tho' it pursued us making more &amp; more noise the nearer we got <u>home</u>."
    Many of these stories bear a great resemblance to those extravagant tales of
la Béte a la Grande Queue, Loup Garoup, Chasse Galerie &amp; many others
natural to superstitious people, it requires therefore a great deal of caution &amp;
attention to get at the true ones. I have here <u>inserted</u> more than I originally intended,
but they will serve to give you an idea of the notions of these people; &amp; except a few, I have
selected those that appeared most rational: <u>however</u> <u>they</u> <u>will</u> <u>all</u> <u>come</u> <u>in</u> <u>time</u>.

There is a kind of disease(or distemper rather, &amp; of the <u>mind</u>, I am fully persuaded,) peculiar to the
Crees &amp; Sauteux's &amp; of which they have the greatest dread &amp; horor; &amp; certainly not without the
very greast cause, the consequences 49 times out of 50 being death unfortunately to many be-
sides the <u>subjects</u> or objects themselves. They term <u>this</u> Wen-di-go (according to the
french pronunciation, which is more correct than the English, in this word)&mdash;the pro-
per signification of which, to me at least, &amp; no one I think can doubt it, is <b><u>Giant</u></b> of the
Anthropophagi <u>Genus</u>, sect, tribe, or kind &amp;c. The stories related of these are as extravagant
&amp; fantastatic as those we read in our old romances <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>days</u> <u>of</u> <u>Chivalry</u>; differing in no one
circumstance hardly but the means used in their destruction, which of course is often done by
the intervention or assistance of their Guardian Genii. However, there are some few more ra-
tional than those of <u>ours</u> &amp; tho' still beyond all bounds of credibility, are as devoutly be-
lieved by these poor creatures as the Gospel is by the most orthodox among us. I do not
remember any of these sufficiently correctly to give you a few of the stories, one excepted:&mdash;
&mdash;Suffice it to say that they are of uncommon size&mdash;Goliath is an unborn infant to them;
&amp; to add to their <u>dread</u>, they are represented as possessing much of
the Power of Magicians. Their head reaching to the tops of the highest <u>Poplars</u> (about 70, or 80,
feet) they are of proportionate <u>size</u>, of course they must be very heavy: their gait tho grand
&amp; majestic, at every step the Earth shakes. They frequently pursue their Prey (<u>indians</u> of
course) invisibly, yet they cannot so completely divest themselves of all the incommodi-
ties of nature as to prevent their approach being known. A  secret &amp; unaccountable horor pervades
the whole system of one, several, or the whole band, of those of whom he is in pursuit:
Phenomena in the heavens, earth &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;"In the days of <u>Noah</u> (or near them at least) there
were a large party of <u>indians</u> collected together for mutual safety: many camps
had been already destroyed by him, &amp; the indians were in great danger being entirely ex-
terminated. At last they bethought  themselves of a plan. "It is needles to go to war upon him&mdash;
"&mdash;what can we do to him with our arms! Let us make an immense Large trap (of wood)
"&amp; draw lots which of us shall serve as bait: it is a dangerous assay indeed, but will any
generous one amongst us refuse sacrificing his life for the safety of so many?"&mdash;They made
this trap on the opposite side of a small opening in the woods, so that he might see the
person seated from afar. it was between large trees which were made to serve as <u>Posts</u>.
It was finished. An old woman stepped up &amp; said "My Grandchildren! I am now
"old &amp; of no more account among ye: we are all in danger of being devoured by this insatiable
"&amp; terrible beast, why should I then regret sacrificing a life that at best I can now
"enjoy but only for a short time, seeing it will in the end be productive of so much good?
"<u>I</u> <u>will</u> <u>go</u> <u>&amp; be</u> <u>bait</u>." The others were extremely touched at her generosity, but they had no
alternative, &amp; circumstances admitted of no delay. The old lady seated herself very com-

composedly in the trap &amp; awaited his arrival: the others fled off of course. It was time too, for he soon <u>hove</u> in
sight!&mdash;Stalking along in all the stile &amp; terror of Imperial Gradeur, his head equal with the tops
of the highest trees, &amp; the ground shaking at every step, tho' froze, it being then depth of winter,
&amp; his countenance denoting an assemblage of pity, contempt, rage &amp; voraciousness.  All this
did not dismay the old Lady: she remained quiet:&mdash;he perceived her&mdash;"What! What
"old woman, art thou doing there?" But changing his tone, which he did several times thus
continued; "Thou art of my natural enemies &amp; I shall presently Grind thee." "Ah! my
"Grand Child! I am an old woman, abandoned &amp; deserted by those whom I have suckled &amp; bro't
"up: they are fled off in dread of thee, &amp; being old &amp; helpless they thrust me in this tuft of trees
"so as to be the less embarrassed: come now &amp; assist me out &amp; in acknowledgement I shall
"inform thee of their precautions, otherwise thou'lt lose thy life by their deceptions." He
was in no dread of the <u>indians</u>, so far as regarded their <u>own</u> Power, but he thought a little
salutary advice would not be amiss, intending after this to <u>Grind</u> the old <u>thing</u> as he had pro-
mised himself. He drew up: "what a devil of a place they have put thee indeed&mdash;did they
think to conceal thee from me?"&mdash;He stooped to enter: when she found he had entered
far enough she touched a stick &amp; down came all the weights &amp; cross bar upon his
back. Tho' he was uncommonly strong the weight, &amp; suddenness of the blow was such
that he gave way &amp; was jamed between the two beams or bars&mdash;here he struggled denouncing
vengeance &amp; eternal destruction to the whole of the <u>human</u> race. The great bellowing
he made was a signal to the men who were in ambush not far off: they came
running up &amp; soon dispatched him with a multitude of blows from axes &amp; Chissels
&amp;c. &amp;c."&mdash;Thus were they for <u>one</u> <u>time</u> releived: the women &amp; children returned
to the camp &amp; enjoyed themselves as usual without further apprehensions. These Gi-
ants as far as I can learn reside somewhere about the <u>North</u> <u>Pole</u>; &amp; even at this day
frequently pay their unwelcome visits, but which however, are attended with a complete
fright only. It seems also that they delegate their Power to the indians occasionly; &amp;
<u>this</u> occasions that cannibalism which is Produced or proceeds rather from a sort of
distemper much resembling <u>maniaism</u>. There are 3 sorts or kinds that I
know of, &amp; beleive there are no more.  The first I have already related as above, &amp; the
2 I am going to give you are sometimes <u>compounded</u> together &amp; sometimes <u>independent</u>;
but they are both equally true &amp;  melancly &amp; distressing in whatever light we may view
them: However, I shall not pretend by any means to palm <u>all</u> that is said about
them upon you as true&mdash;of this you'll by &amp; bye be able to judge as well as myself
&amp; not doubt. The first of these are such as are driven to this dreadful extremity by
starvation. In all <u>woody</u> countries where the inhabitants lead a wandering, roving life, &amp; whose
subsistence depend upon the Game they procure, they must of necessity be frequently pinched, &amp; some-
times bro't very low. All <u>People</u> cannot bear this privation alike &amp; tho'  there is perhaps not a

a people in this world who take this so patiently as those people do, yet there are not wanting in-
stances where even with them that <u>nature</u>  gives-way. They vanish as a <u>dying</u> Candle; but others can-
not stand it out so long: they must have something to eat, be it what it may: sometimes, tho'  with
the most extreme reluctance at first, they feed upon the flesh of such as <u>have</u> <u>died</u>. Any kind of
animal substance at such times, must come very grateful to the Stomack; &amp; hence it is I be-
lieve that those who have once preyed upon their fellows, ever after feel a great desire for the
same nourishment, &amp; are not so scrupulous about the means of procuring it. I have seen
several that had been reduced this distressing alternative, &amp; tho' many years after there ap-
peared to me a wildness in their eyes, a confusion in their countenances much resem-
bling that of reprieved murderers....Now if we consider how very precarious their
mode of subsistance is, how devoted they are to superstition &amp; prejudice, we, i. e. such of <u>us</u>
as know more about them, we, I say, may wonder how they stand out so well: very many
instances I have known seem to be far beyond the power of human nature to stand:&mdash;Yet
notwithstanding this dreadful privation lasts not for a few days, but even to weeks &amp; months,
during all which time the men are out from star-light to star-light &amp; have never
anything more to <u>eat</u> than some bits of leather, moss, bark &amp; such like, it is very rare they
will kill a <u>fellow</u> to <u>live</u> upon him. This is not universal, there are unfortunately still
too many exceptions; but these again would seem as denounciations from their Gods&mdash;
&mdash;They appear so to me--- I can scarcely doubt it! and the indians themselves seem to think
the same tho' in another way. At this place where I am now writing (Lac La Ronge, English River) but
a few years back several instances occurred. An old Canadian is said to have lost one of his
Sons thus, tho' an excellent hunter: the old man sometimes speakes to me of that son: and the
second died on his way to the house, &amp;  not far off. The same year an indian killed all
his family but 2 daughters whom he compelled to partake with him, &amp; for the rest of the
route he ........&mdash;I shall here give you a few stories of the kind. "<u>That</u> same
"year (I do not know precisely when but only a few years back) a woman alone arrived at the
"house. Her appearance was haggard, wild, &amp; distressed: However she was taken into <u>the</u> house&mdash;
"questions put as usual, but the answers, vague, indefinite &amp; contradictory: they
"handed her something to eat&mdash;she acted as if eating it indeed, but let the whole fall in
"the <u>inside</u> of her gown: this rose suspicion. But what added to this was the extra-
"ordinary stench she emitted from the heat of the chimney; &amp; shortly after her entrance, a
"part of a human shoulder the Dogs bro't in from upon her road. She went off&mdash;being
"directed upon a road leading to a camp not far off. As soon as she made her appearance the indians
"immediately conceived what was to matter; but thro' charity as well as for safety &amp; to find the
"truth they gave her to eat, principally marrow-fat." Now these people pretend that cannibals
cannot bear this fat or grease, of course it was a kind of <u>ordeal</u>. "Every thing she did &amp; said, notwithstand-
"ing her great caution, betrayed her. She took up some of the children of her acquaintances to kiss

"kiss as is customary but would have given it a bite had they not taken it from her. They wat-
"ched her narrowly. All the men slept in one tent with her: she pretended to be asleep 'till
"she imagined the others were, then rose very cautiously &amp; was beginning to prepare herself for <u>action</u>
"&mdash;One of the men perceived this&mdash;rose upon her with an axe; tho' the blow was violent &amp;
"upon the head she would have killed him had not the others interfered: her wretched fate
"was soon decided." There is such a singular, strange, incomprehensible contradictoriness in
almost all these cases, &amp; many I have heard, that I do most verily believe they are <u>denun</u>-
ciations, witch, or wizardisms: in any other manner they are not rationally to be account-
ed for, unless we suppose all those who feed on human flesh to be thus possest,&mdash;then it
is natural to man in those cases; but why then not the same with us as with these people?
&mdash;The 3d Kind, or delegated, which by what follows, I believe may be allowed to be
the term, are those who dream of the North, or the Ice, or both. Every one knows
where the North resides, but only few know the abode of Ice, or the Ice. This they pretend is the
Parent of Ice, is in the bowels of the Earth, at a great depth &amp; never thaws&mdash;all ice originates
from this. These 2 they are much afraid of, because they are both highly malignant spi-
rits: there is no joking or jesting with them. Those who at <u>any</u> future period are to become
cannibals thus dream of them. After the certain things usual in all dreams  "I was
"invited by the North to partake of a feast of ducks, the most beautiful I had ever seen
"&amp; well cooked&mdash;the dish was before me,  I set <u>too</u>: a stranger by me touched me with his elbow &amp; said, Eat not thou
"of that; look into thy dish; behold that which I had taken for the wing of a duck was
"the arm of a child! 'he! what a narrow escape'! said I. Then he took me into another
"room &amp; gave me most excellent meat, the most delicious in appearance I had ever seen
"I would not eat&mdash;I discovered it was the flesh of <u>indians</u> thus served up to me! He
"took me into a 3d room &amp; gave me Tongues: These I also perceived were the Tongues of <u>in</u>-
"dians. 'Why refusest thou what I offer thee? is it not good?' 'I feel no inclination
"'to eat' I replied. Then he took me in a fourth room where fine beautiful
"<u>hearts</u> were served up, &amp; I was desired to eat, but I perceived that it was still the same
"I therefore refused. Then said he 'it is well done&mdash;thou hast done well!' Heh! had I unfor-
"tunately eaten of this then had I become a cannibal in addition to all my other misfortunes."
    Those who eat at these feasts are frequently, but not universally told thus: " This is a sign to
"thee that thou shalt one day become a cannibal &amp; feed on the flesh of thy fellows&mdash;When
"thou shalt see children play with, &amp; eat, ice (or snow) <u>in</u> thy Tent say 'my time is near';
"for then thou shalt soon eat <u>indian</u> (human) flesh." They have such dread &amp; horor of
this that it is constantly in their minds. "You white people! who live at your ease, get your
"living out of your Nets or from your indians, &amp; besides are not otherwise troubled as we,
"make light of these Things:&mdash;I do not make much  account of them either, but I tell you that he
"who thus once dreams of either of those Dogs are for ever after continually troubled with them

"&mdash;we do every thing in our Power to drive him away from us, but still he hovers about us &amp; we can-
"not avoid him. You are very fortunate&mdash;you live as you please, never care for him nor does he molest
"you."&mdash;Such I am told are the <u>sentiments</u> of these people in General. I look upon this
as a sort of mania, a fever, a distemper of the brain. Their eyes (for I have seen thus perplexd)
are wild &amp; uncommonly clear&mdash;they seem as if they glistened&mdash;It seems to me to
lodge in the Head. They are generally rational except at short, sudden intervals when the
paroxysms cease them: their motions then are various &amp; diametrically contrary at one
time to what they are the next moment&mdash;Sullen, thoughtful, wild look &amp; perfectly
mute:&mdash;staring in sudden convulsions, wild incoherent &amp; extravagant language.
There was one a few years back infected with this not far from where I was at
the time: the accounts given of him, tho' I shall not vouch for their truth are
thus. One night towards the latter end of December he began staring at his daugh-
ter with an extraordinary intenseness: "My daughter! I am fond of thee! I love
"thee extremely"&mdash;"I know thou dost" replied the woman abashed, for she was then
very young"&mdash;Yes! I love thee&mdash;I think I could eat a piece of thee, I love thee
"so much". The Girl exclaimed at his rashness&mdash;there were but 3 of them
the father, daughter &amp; her husband. When it was dark he put himself stark-naked &amp;
uttering a strong tremulous noise, &amp; his teeth chattering in his head as if thro' cold, rose
up &amp; walked out of the Tent &amp; laid himself curled as a dog in a heap upon the wood
that his daughter had that day bro't to the door. Here he remained all night in-
spite of what they could do. A little before day he returned. Thus did he every
night for about a month &amp; every time slept out naked; nor would he eat,
excepting at times a little raw flesh. In the day time he was more composed,
but his face &amp;c. bore the appearance of one possessed of the Devil. He recovered &amp;
became as usual, composed, &amp; good natured&mdash;I knew them all well, but had no
dealings with them from the year before (1812)&mdash;A young indian a few years
back had <b><u>one</u></b> of the above Dreams. He became very uneasy &amp; thoughtful finding it recur
so  very frequently: &amp; he would have willing undergone any torments any death rather than
become an anthropophagi: he also frequently desired his friends upon any, the least appear-
ance of these symptoms in him to kill him. "For if you do not kill me 'till I have eaten of <u>human</u>
"flesh, you'll perhaps not be able to do it afterwards; but my Children! Oh! my children!
"how grieved am I to leave ye! but it must be so&mdash;I have no alternative." "Spare me
"not, my friends I conjure you"! He had been a good hunter &amp; a peaceable indian, &amp; of course
much loved by his friends: this business depressed them a great deal. At last the time approach-
ing fast his brother one day remained behind with him to watch him, whilst the others pitch-
ed off: about the time this one thought the others had finished the encampment he proposed their
setting off to join them. But before long he left his brother behind &amp; laid an ambush for him not

not far from the Tent. This was a preconcerted scheme, the other men of course were not far off.
The sick one drew near, in a very slow &amp; thoughtful manner: however when he came near to where
his brother was hid, he stopped, looked up &amp; called out "Thou thinkest thyself well hid from
"me my brother, but I see thee: it is well thou undertakest, it had been better for thee however
"hadst thou began sooner. Remember what I told you all&mdash;it is my <u>heart</u>; my <u>heart</u>, that is
"<u>terrible</u>, &amp; however you may injure my body if you do not completely annihilate my <u>heart</u>
"nothing is done." The brother was sure that he was not discovered, this <u>knowledge</u> being the
information of some of the spirits: he therefore did not answer. Some of the other men had
gone to meet him &amp; endeavoured to amuse him that the brother might give the first
blow: accordingly he shot, straight for the heart&mdash;he dropped, but rose immediately,
&amp; continued towards the camp that was within sight laughing at their undertaking. "The
"Ball went through &amp; through, but not a drop of blood was seen&mdash;<u>his</u> <u>heart</u> <u>was</u> <u>alrea</u>-
"<u>ready</u> <u>formed</u> <u>into</u> <u>Ice</u>."  Here they seized &amp; bound him &amp; with ice chissels &amp; axes
set to work to dispatch him. "According to his desire they had collected a large pile
"of dry wood &amp; laid him upon it.&mdash;The body was soon consumed, but the heart remained perfect
"&amp; entire" it rolled several times off the Pile&mdash;They replaced it as often: fear ceased them&mdash;
"then with their (Ice) chissels they cut &amp; hacked it into small bits,  but yet with diffi-
"culty was it consumed"!!! They fancy that blood which circulated thro' the heart
first turns into water, then coagulates or congeals, &amp; shortly after becomes into solid
imperforable or impenetrable ice. The only antidote or remedy for this, is to give them
large draughts of high-wines; double distilled spirits, or the spirits of wine, if any
can be had the better: this taken in large draughts &amp; frequently, &amp; <u>kept</u> beside a large
fire, flows to the heart &amp; thaws the ice: if a profuse sweat ensues it is a happy
omen. An indian with me this winter gave out his apprehensions that he was thus
tormented&mdash;I communicated it to 2 others who happened to come in about that time: "Why do you not give him
"large draughts of your strongest spirits to drink &amp; keep him in the room beside a large
"fire." I replied that I was afraid it would burn him "Oh! no&mdash;if he is a real
"Wendigo it will only do him good by driving out the ice; but if he <b><u>lies</u></b> to you indeed,
"then it certainly will injure him; but it will be good for him, &amp; teach him for the future
"not to impose upon people to frighten them." However, they are in general kind &amp;
extremely indulgent to those thus infected: they seem to consider it as an infliction &amp;
are desirous of doing all they can to assist. There are however many exceptions: but these
again depend upon the circumstances &amp;c. attending them. One of my best hunters here
is thus tormented, or at least thus torments himself; &amp; very often desires his friends in
compassion to put a period to existence the first symptoms he may shew of cannibalism.
A young girl lately maried, &amp; scarcely worth a <u>Filip</u>, so small &amp; diminutive, was this winter
seized with this phrensy&mdash;the consequence was that the men durst not leave the tent for any

any length of time, being obliged to assist the women in holding &amp; preventing her from biting or eating
any of the children, &amp; perhaps herself. They bethought of a sacrifice i.e. cropping her hair &amp; short&mdash;
&mdash;she recovered &amp; is now well. She says "I do not recollect any single one circumstance of all that
"is told me.&mdash;I thought I was always on the tops of the Trees." There is another one of my in-
dians thus affected too.  The indians say it is a punishment (from some of their <u>familiars</u> of
course) for so lightly esteeming their ceremonies; nay indeed &amp; ridiculing them often. This
fall he began: there were but 2 men of them together (with each his family)&mdash;Things
bore a most dismal aspect;&mdash;at last the wife of the other,  who by-the-bye is said to
a little affected that way too, told him one day that he sprang forward to seize one of
<u>his</u> <u>own</u> children, to "keep quiet, for thou dog if a Gun hath no effect on thee, my
" axe shall&mdash;I shall chop thee up into slices:&mdash;thou hast then better be quiet."
This kept him indeed quiet for some time: how they are now I cannot say, not hav-
ing heard of them from the beginning of Dec<u>r</u> (now Apl. 20<u>th</u>). They appear most
inclined to prey <u>first</u> upon their own family: &amp; they also think that fire arms
are absolutely unable to injure them&mdash;"a ball cannot injure <u>Ice</u>: to destroy
"<u>Ice</u>, it must be <u>chopped</u> <u>up</u>: &amp; the <u>heart</u> <u>then</u> <u>is</u> <u>all</u> <u>Ice</u>." They sometimes,
indeed frequently recover with the warm weather "for the sun then <u>animates</u>
all nature"!!!&mdash;There are many other instances of a like kind in their tendency
or consequences, but different in their proceedings that I cannot bring to mind at present: I men-
tion several of these to shew you the different manner they are infected&mdash;in the mean time
I shall relate you others not less entertaining. There are several Spirits of whom these
people are much afraid, but four principally, they being the most malignant &amp; little
accepting of <u>excuses</u> however great &amp; urgent they may be for the non performance of <u>their</u>
sacrifices. These are the <u>North</u>, <u>Ice</u>, <u>Skeletons</u> &amp; the <u>Crazy</u> <u>woman</u>, or foolish,
mad, jealous, woman. "Not very many years ago an indian had entered his conjuring <u>hut</u>.
"She came among the rest; but being displeased with the conjuror on account of some
"sacrifice to other spirits, she seized &amp; carried him off! Skeleton perceived it, &amp;
"being of the conjuror pursued Jealousy: finding herself nearly overtaken she prefered
"her own safety to vengeance &amp; let the <u>indian</u> fall <u>in</u> <u>some</u> <u>place</u> at a vast dis-
"tance from where he had been taken&mdash;Skeleton took him up &amp; bro't him back
"to the great satisfaction of all parties"! "She frequently comes with the <u>others</u>
when <u>they</u> conjure, but on her appearance she is desired to be quiet "<u>Pay-ah-tick</u>"
i.e. gently, quietly, peaceably &amp;c." Master Skeleton also is as much dreaded as
Folly, if-not more, because he shews himself at any time he pleases, it not being
necessary to conjure to call him to. There <u>is</u> an indian who before he married had his
<u>Dress</u> <u>Shoes</u> made by this Lady (Folly, or Jealousy)&mdash;She was of course extremely fond of him"&mdash;"The shoes
"were beautifully garnished, far superior to anything of the kind done by <u>our</u> women"! There are not

wanting Ladies living with the white who confer full share of their <u>favors</u> on some of the in-
dians; &amp; from one of these I fancy it is he got these shoes; but to hide the business imput-
ed them to Folly, which served him a double end. If I can see that Chap I shall be very
particular in my inquiries of him&mdash;I know him well. This brings to my mind the
<u>White</u> <u>Stag</u> or Hind, <u>Sertorius</u> had in his exile &amp; during his wars with his country as
mentioned by Plutarch. Indeed&mdash;to be candid, <b><u>I</u></b> find a very great affinity between the
ideas &amp; notions of these people &amp; those of the Greeks &amp; Romans &amp;c. &amp;c. And by these, much,
far much better, than by the incongruous hypothesis of the learned might be traced the
<u>origin</u> of these people; &amp; I am far from taking the task to be difficult: would <u>we</u>
only divest ourselves of <u>our</u> <u>own</u> prejudices &amp; take the proper plan this great <u>Enigma</u>,
if I may so explain myself, would be not perfectly cleared I allow, but a rational
clew afforded to the unravelling of it. I have read many of these <u>hypo</u>-
<u>thesis</u> but they are so filled with inconsistencies that I could scarcely believe men could
employ so much time in them ..... I could say something else instead of the conclusion
of this last sentence.  A Gentleman, &amp; an Englishman too, but I forget his name, would
wish to <u>insinuate</u> that these people are from a different origin with ourselves i.e.
Adam; &amp; to prove his hypothesis he begins by an anatomising hogs! (See the Encyclopae-
dia, not by Rees, but <u>Fitz-Patrick</u> I believe) This puts me in mind of some of the
<u>Newtonian</u> <u>Systems</u> i.e. there is no such thing in nature a <u>Cold</u>&mdash;we must
say <u>an</u> <u>absence</u> of <u>Heat</u>! why cannot we as well say there is no such thing as <u>dark</u>-
<u>ness</u>, but merely an <u>absence</u> <u>of</u> <u>light</u>, or reverse either, &amp; either will be as reasonable
&mdash;most strange reasoning is this indeed!
    <b>Confession</b>. These People have a notion that <u>confession</u> saves them
from many accidents &amp; also preserves the lives of the Sick, or rather restores them to
their wonted health &amp;c. I have not learned the  origin of this; when, why, or wherefore, but it
seems to be very remote, to have sprang with their mythology. I shall it make a point to enquire
very particularly into this; &amp; for this, as well as other things, at different quarters, to find &amp; detect
<u>errors</u> &amp;c. but all, however, that I have written in these pages, tho' there may be some difference
in the recital &amp; perhaps a <u>few</u> stragling circumstances, are, I have great reason to think
fundamentally the same throughout among these people....... When any one
of them is particularly affected with diseases out of the common course of nature <u>here</u>,
or, tho' the disease may be precisely the same as all others, yet from certain circumstan-
ces, individually, or a combination of them, they say he is Oh-gee-nay in Cree,
or On-gee-nay in Sauteux (the On- pronounced as in french &amp; <u>not</u> English), by which
it would seem as if they meant he was afflicted or chastised for his own sins, or those of some
of his or her, near relatives, i.e. father, mother &amp;c. if children: if grown up &amp; married persons,
for their own.  Whether they only imagine this, or are informed of it by conjuring, <u>private</u> <u>infor</u>-

information from their <u>Familiars</u>, or from the Symptoms of the Sick person &amp;c. &amp;c. I cannot say,
but the thus afflicted person must confess his Sins publickly. Now in these confessions as in
all their other discourses or conversations (<u>initiating</u> &amp; <u>giving</u> <u>of</u> <u>medicines</u>, <u>excepted</u>) they use no
circumlocution, no secret or enigmatical word or term, to screen themselves; but all is de-
livered in plain terms &amp; before every one that chuses to hear: These confessions are ter-
rible things; &amp; they seem far more sincere &amp; complete than those of many catholics.
&mdash;They have wonderful retentive memories, &amp; no scene, no crime from their earliest
years unto that day do they hide. But Great God! what abominations!&mdash;one would
scarcely imagine the human mind capable of inventing such infamously dia-
bolical actions as <u>some</u> do commit: murder, incest, &amp; other things if possible an
hundred fold more debasing the human Soul. Whether they repent of these things neither
can I say, but it would appear as if they were the acts of a contrite &amp; most humbly
penitant Soul. I have never had an opportunity of hearing these from <u>their</u> <u>own</u> mouths,
but <u>other</u> indians have told me of them, &amp; tho' before their families <u>sometimes</u>, have never
omitted one single circumstance from the suggestions of the idea down to the very
last <u>conclusion</u>. When I heard of these things at first, I <u>would</u> <u>not</u> beleive them; but hearing
them come so circumstantially <u>I</u> <u>trembled</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>Land</u> <u>I</u> <u>sojourned</u> <u>in</u> "lest it should
vomit me out as the land of Canaan did its inhabitants" "or be swallowed up in
its destruction as Sodom &amp; Gomorrah"! It is true they are not <u>all</u> so; no, I
am told there are but few, &amp; in charity I hope it is; otherwise what will be my
fate seeing I am in a certain degree partaker with them! Surely the inha-
bitants of such a land, at <u>best</u>, cannot look for more than mere <u>present</u> <u>enjoy</u>-
<u>ment</u>. When I reflect seriously on <u>all</u> these things as I sometimes do, revolv
ving them in every different manner in my mind it is beyond the power of
words to express my feelings. Poor unfortunate blind Creatures! That it is
from <u>Blindness</u> they commit these things. I am fully persuaded, because I am equally confi-
dent that they do not attach that same degree of criminality to them we, <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>re</u>-
<u>vealing</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Scriptures</u> to us, do: some, they consider in the light of trifles; some natural; some
weaknesses: but all tend to the gratification of most Bestial appetites, whatever may
have been the original cause, <u>curiosity</u>, or otherwise. However, I received a piece of infor-
mation in one of these, &amp; <u>it</u> was circumstantially  detailed, that has cleared a point to
me I could never solve: &amp; Tho I enquired of both Wool &amp; Bob, they were not wiser than my-
self. Indeed, without the <u>trial</u> or experiment, it seems impossible to say certainly
where the cause lies: now I know it, if ever an opportunity offers, or that it pleases God I
again revisit my own lands I shall be able to speak to a certainty. As I cannot write
Latin, I shall say no more of <u>it</u> at present.&mdash;

&amp; from this conceived himself <u>ongenay</u> &amp; accordingly prepared for his Confession.
Having received the details at 2 &amp; 3d hand I shall endeavour to give <u>part</u> of them to you as near <u>their</u>
Stile as I can; but really I find myself <u>very</u> <u>inadequate</u> to the task: there is a certain
<u>Poetic</u> <u>Sublimity</u> in their language on such <u>like</u> occasions as will not easily meet with credit
from those (the better informed) of the civilized world unacquainted with these people. Even
amongst ourselves there are but few; for few can judge of the beauties of a language &amp; most of
those few have too hi a notion of their own mighty superiority to stoop to <u>regular</u> conver-
sation with them: But to return: after having revealed all, or most part of his Sins to
the company in general he thus addressed his family in particular&mdash;"You see my Chil-
"dren my distressed state: I cannot move nor stir without assistance, &amp; I feel strengthened
"in my lungs (breast, heart) merely as it were by Permission of my <u>Dreamed</u> (some parti-
"cular one he meant) "to divulge my offenses to the Gods (or God) publicly, before you
"you all, to deter you from the same vices (wickednesses). I was once a young man also, the
"same as you are now, healthy &amp; vigorous; nothing appeared difficult nor dangerous to me&mdash;
"I lived as became a man, &amp; prospered accordingly; but I thought that this proceeded from my
"own Power only: had I so continued, all had been well! but no, I <u>unfortunately</u> heard
"speake of Such indians (meaning <u>this</u> place, <u>as</u> <u>my</u> <u>informants</u> <u>tell</u> <u>me</u>), how powerful
"they were in their medicines, the extraordinary feats they performed. I envied them, &amp;
"thought that I required but <u>that</u> knowledge more to render me perfect (immortal) &amp;
"happy:&mdash;I undertook a voyage to that place: I found that the  bare truth had been
"scarcely told me&mdash;I burned with anxiety to becoming as knowing as themselves &amp; I
"was gratified. Had I rested here, all had yet been well; but in learning their me-
"decines I also learned of them those vices, those sins, that by <u>their</u> <u>practice</u> have
"reduced me to this wretched situation. My Sons!  take example from your father!
"be good, charitable, &amp; peaceable indians as I was at the first set off of my life, &amp; employ the
"same means, indulge use the same  anxiety to <u>avoid</u>, that I did to <u>procure</u>, that information
"that hath reduced me so far below the level even of a dog. Never forget this, never in-
"dulge even the least desire of such acquisitions; for if you once begin you will be
"deluded by their flattery to that destruction I have found. But you are young men! &amp;
"unless you find grace you also will be deluded &amp; lost as I am"! I have heard a good
deal said of <u>this</u> indian's confession &amp; exhortations to his Sons&mdash;they were not lost. He
himself lived but a short time &amp; seemed much comforted by <u>it</u>.
  There is a tribe of <u>Athabasca</u> that go by the name of <u>Beaver</u> <u>Indians</u>. From
the tenets of their religion I <u>am</u> <u>told</u> that when laying under any malediction, be-
wichisms, &amp;c. or conceive themselves so, they make a vow that the first animal the shall
kill they will do <u>So</u>&mdash;they do not fail, but immediately proceed in quest of another which by this
diabolical action they think they will soon find &amp; kill. They do not <u>touch</u> the animal afterwards as

as those Beasts among the Crees &amp; Sauteux do, but leave it lay as a sacrifice: they consider it as a
duty imposed upon them; but the others do it from mere beastiality. "Such a one did so, bro't home
"part of the meat, &amp; we all of us eat it&mdash;O! the Dog!" said an indian not long ago to me.
    Lest I may not soon have another opportunity of writing on these Subjects to <u>you</u> I shall
add a few more <u>fragments</u>. An indian here, passing for a great Doctor was applied to
(&amp; is still) by many to attend upon them. "Several of these he retrieved from death: One
"of his dreamed, I beleive the North, was not pleased &amp; told the Doctor 'never to administer
"'his medecines to those he had doomed to death.' The Dr replied it was hard &amp; unchari-
"table seeing he could prolong their days a little. ' Well! for every one that thou dost
"'deprive me of, I shall take one of thy children'; &amp; the Dr lost 8 or 9. (I cannot
"now remember well); but he is now grown more cautious". But this Dr is himself a
beast. "Being unable to stand from sickness he told 2 of his wives 'Take ye me one
"'under each arm to my sweat-heart.&mdash;I feel myself dying &amp; dont chuse <u>thus</u> to
"'go': &amp; he actually did. Remember, I <u>am</u> <u>told</u> <u>this</u>; but I have reasons to beleive it.
&mdash;He is an incestuous beast: otherwise I find him a good indian &amp; what is most
strange, sensible beyond many of his equals.&mdash;
    I have got a caracature here of the Devil carrying off a Taylor. I asked one
of my indians if any of their familiars resembled him &amp; how they were,&mdash;the reply was "Yes,
"he resides in the North (at the Pole I suppose) &amp; has a vast number of young men: The
"indians report of some finding their tracks that are very numerous &amp; exactly resemble the
"tracks of the Grey Deer (carriboeuf); but neither him nor his young men are very wick-
"ed: North, Ice, Skeleton, &amp; Folly are the most wicked &amp; ill inclined of all those
we dream of, or enter the conjuring box"!&mdash;
    Of their <b>Feasts</b>, I cannot say more than any common observer&mdash;I have been in-
vited, &amp; partaken of many of them, but I never thought of enquiring into their origin, the
causes &amp;c. of them. But from the little I could learn or rather understand from the
speeches made at <u>all</u> of them, &amp; what I have learnt  in regard to other things, I think
may say without dreading contradiction, that as there are songs, ceremonies &amp;c.
appropriate to every one of their Gods or Familiars or Devils, there also <u>feasts</u> made for
each according to the whim, dream, or some other circumstance of the one who makes them.
   We denominate these Feasts, &amp; from their own Term it would seem they so mean;
but I consider this again as a premature interpretation which I have not leisure to
explain: I consider them rather as <u>sacrifices</u>&mdash;indeed they may perhaps rather
be esteemed as partaking of both. I have somewhere above said that they are <u>obliged</u>
to make an annual sacrifice to some of their Gods as the non-performance passes not
off with impunity&mdash;these therefore are obligatory, or compulsory sacrifices; but besides these
they also have Free-will sacrifices. These Feasts or sacrifices are not <u>universally</u> of

of <u>Flesh</u>:&mdash;they have them of Flesh, Grease, dried berries, rum, &amp;c. &amp;c. and few of these
Feasts are made without <u>the</u> <u>one</u> <u>who</u> <u>makes</u> <u>it</u> offers a certain (very small, only a few mouths-
ful) to <u>him</u> whom it is in honor of, or intended for, which he most commonly puts into
the fire, <u>in</u> or on, the Ground. Some of them are very grand &amp; ceremonius:&mdash;the <u>tit</u>
bits of the animal only, as the head, heart, &amp; liver, tongue, &amp; paws when of a Bear: It is
only the Great men that are allowed to eat of these: Others again, besides the above, the
brisket, rump &amp; ribbs; &amp; very seldom a woman is allowed to partake of them, parti-
cularly if it is <u>un</u> <u>festin</u> <u>à</u> <u>tout</u> <u>manger</u>, i. e. to eat the whole; tho'  there may be
sufficient for 2 or 3 times the number of Guests, all must be eaten before day; tho' in
certain cases the Feaster is obliged, &amp; commonly does, take part back, providing a
knife, a bit of tobacco, or something else attend with the dish. In these great
Feasts the feaster makes one or several Speeches before <u>we</u> begin to eat, &amp; one again
after all is done,  &amp; sometimes sings, beats the drum &amp; speec<u>hes</u> during the whole
time of the feast, never partaking of a morsel himself. At Some of them there is
dancing to be performed: I happened to be called to one of these many years ago
&mdash;it was the principal parts of a bear; &amp; the Paunch had been filled with the
liver, heart &amp; fat with blood, minced, &amp; much resembling that dish the Scotch
term <u>haggish</u>: we were all very hungry &amp; tho' we gormandized (it cannot be
called<u> eating</u>) there yet remained full 2/3ds. The Feaster was uneasy &amp; said he would
have been proud had we eaten all, for in that case his Dreamed would have been
propitious: we were obliged to dance also; but when I could stow no more I gave him
my knife &amp; a bit of Tobacco &amp; walked off leaving him to settle with his God as well
as he could; but indeed I was not very scrupulous then, otherwise I had most
certainly avoided many of them, tho' it is oftentimes dangerous if there be not
method or qualification in the refusal. Their feasts of rum are often to some
one of the 4 wicked ones, praying them to be propitious &amp; not allow themselves to be
influenced by the wicked sollicitations of envious indians. Many years ago I
happened to be out a hunting a few miles from the house &amp; came unexpectedly
upon the lodge of a few indians I had that day given rum to. I heard one of
them harangue, &amp; drew up cautiously to listen&mdash;He entreated the rain, snow &amp;
frost to have pity upon their young ones (that they might kill) &amp;c. I commu-
nicated this a few years after to a couple of Gentlemen&mdash;one of them longer
in the country than myself denied it &amp; enquired of his wife who had lived a
long time with the indians&mdash;she corroborated his denial&mdash;I perceived the
cause, &amp; told him that it was because <u>they</u> do not chuse that we become too well
informed of all their ceremonies: it was to no effect, &amp; I had almost a mind to credit
the woman too myself, but by <u>insinuation</u> I find I am perfectly right. Thus it

it happens in almost every thing else: a thing that does not meet with our approbation, or be a
little beyond the Sphere of our limited information, we immediately deny or condemn; whereas by
taking <b><u>proper</u></b> measures to enquire or inform ourselves not only those things themselves but others
far more interesting, &amp; sometimes too of the greatest moment, whether to ourselves or others, are rendered
probable, reasonable, certain. Hence it is also that many upon receiving a piece of informa-
tion there rest themselves as upon a Rock of certainty. Now either of these I consider
equally blameable as they lead to distrust, doubt, &amp; sometimes to a complete refutation or asser-
tion of facts that very oftentimes cast a stain or stigma sometimes upon a whole people.

    They have feasts for the dead, most commonly berries,&mdash;or in countries where it is made,
Sugar: generally yearly a bark box of perhaps 2 or 3 Gallons is placed <u>in</u> the grave, upon
it , or well hid in some private nook, if they are afraid, or do not chuse, it be taken
&mdash;I ought rather to have said these are sacrifices; but independent of these they have Feasts
also, &amp; feasts of Baptism. Feasts inshort for almost every occasion. Besides these
they have <u>smoking</u> <u>feasts</u>: these are to deliberate.&mdash;I shall, should it please God I live,
make it a point to enquire particularly into the origin of all these.&mdash;
    June 5<u>th</u>. These last 3 days have been busy &amp; turbulent ones for me&mdash;it is now
considerably past midnight (&amp; of course the 6<u>th</u> June) but my indians are drinking
&amp;  I cannot think of going to bed Till they do I shall employ my few remaining
<u>leisure</u> moments ('till next year, please god I live so long) in giving you an
account of a conjuring bout I with some difficulty got an indian to make
last night (June <b><u>4</u></b><u>th</u>).&mdash;In the evening the hut was prepared at some dis-
tance from the houses on account of the stink as <u>the Spirits</u> cannot, or will
not endure any pollution&mdash;The hut consisted of 10 poles about 7 feet out
of Ground, well stuck in, &amp; somewhat better than 3 feet diameter&mdash;the
Poles were secured with 2 hoops: they were covered with 2 Parchment skins
(of Moose) well bound with many rounds of strong leather line: <u>the</u>
<u>top</u> <u>was</u> <u><b>covered</b></u> with a dressed skin &amp; secured also, to prevent its being
carried off (by the wind)&mdash;About 10P.M. (still broad day light with
us) we drew up with the conjuror, smoked &amp; chatted some time. after
this he took his drum (much resembling a tambourine) &amp; with a
stick gently struck it all the time he made a speech: I was almost
touching him (all seated) but from the noise of the drum &amp; his low voice,
for the man has a dreadful complaint on his lungs, I could only gather
"Take pity upon me; take pity upon me; hear &amp; come: let me not
speake in vain, nor become abashed&mdash;<u>show</u> me charity" &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;it was
a moderate &amp; decent prayer. After this <u>they</u> (for there were several men) began

began to sing, using the drum &amp; rattler&mdash;they sang among others the moose, horse,
Bear, &amp; Dog Songs; about a dozen in number, when he prepared by taking off his
clothes, all to his cloute, &amp; asked who should tie him, I replied that I would,
but was afraid of hurting him: another conjuror did beginning with his
fingers between the 2 joints nearest the hand nearly as I can describe
it&mdash;thus giving a double turn to the line between each
finger, &amp; the line was new Mackerel, small, which I happened to have
in my pocket by accident.&mdash;I drew up to <u>inspect</u> &amp; observing the fin-
gers to swell upon his complaining of the tightness I felt a good deal for
him. After this his blanket was wrapped round him &amp; tied in such a
manner, lengthways, crossways &amp; every way, &amp; a good knot <u>I</u> tied at
each meeting of the cords; for I assisted in <u>this</u>, that I could have laid
any wager that it was beyond the Power of Spirits themselves, thus tied, to
eradicate themselves; &amp; his hands were <u>under</u> his hams&mdash;as he could no
more move than fly, <u>of himself</u>, the other conjuror &amp; I put him to the
door, but behold! it was with difficulty we could just get his
head in, the entry being too narrow by about 10, or 12 ins. screwing
&amp; jaming considered. "It will do, it will do" said the conjuror&mdash;"cover
me now"&mdash;his back was covered with a blanket &amp; we all retreated
to our seats, myself about 4 feet distant&mdash;The others took the drum
&amp; began to sing. I could not help but laughing in myself &amp; pitying the
boldness of their vanity,&mdash;but I had soon occasion to think other-
wise &amp; had I not predetermined that reason should conduct me throughout the
whole  of this, I cannot say how far in the <u>other</u> extreme <u><b>I</b></u> might have gone.
But to return: the conjuror desired the others to sing, they began a short song,
I believe it was that of the <u>Stone</u>, &amp; the man entered in an instant! I was
struck dumb with astonishment; for he appeared to me to
<u>slide</u> in by something that was neither invisible nor descernible&mdash;I heard some-
thing that for the life of me I cannot account for, &amp; that's all: from the time
we covered him (25.'  Past 10 P.M) to the time we had done hunting for the
twine that tied his fingers, not quite 5 minutes elapsed, &amp; not 1 1/2 minutes
before his blanket &amp; the cords were thrown out to us!&mdash;Not one of them,
apparently (i.e.  one knot) <u>untied</u>!&mdash;My astonishment &amp; apprehen-
sions of his being entirely carried off from us were such, that I was nearly
springing up to haul him out, for fear of his being for ever lost. The others
continued singing a few other songs &amp; I had the utmost anxiety in hearing repeated-
ly call out as if in the greatest apprehensions himself "enough! enough! e-

<b>Enough</b> of ye I say"; &amp; frequently for the space of some minutes repeating the same,
&amp; now &amp; then calling out "do not <u>Thou</u> enter." The <u>Stone</u> was the first one known
to us, by his song; for every one almost that entered sang <u>his</u> song, to which those
(the indians) on the outside would keep chorus. A vast number entered, I verily
beleive upward of an hundred; for upwards of that number of times the frame
shook back-&amp;-forwards and very smartly as if to fall; &amp; among the first
were some truly terrible characters. I have almost entirely converted myself
from these foolish ideas of Ghost &amp; hobgoblins, but I assure you in truth
that I more than once felt very uneasy. The Ice entered&mdash;he made a noise
extremely resembling that made by a person shivering with cold, loud, &amp;
hoarse &amp; <u>liquid</u>. The Devil <u>himself</u> also entered in <u>propria</u> <u>persona</u>, in
a very authoritative &amp; commanding manner: I assure you there was no
laughing nor gigling outside, all the time he sang &amp; spoke. The Turtle
spoke as an old Jocular man. "I hate the french; for in their travels
"when they find me, they kill me &amp; eat me:&mdash;I shall answer none of their questions"
but this was a joke; for he laughed. "Speake out Turtle, speake out, louder that
"we hear the", said those without "&mdash;I would too, replied he, but my voice is
"so strong I must contract it thus otherwise ye could not endure the sound
"of it." "Hop! continued he, I must imitate the drunk", which he did
to the great diversion of us all &amp; concluded with snoring, the natural
end of all drunken feasts &amp; then became quiet, on which another voice
(which I also perfectly heard &amp; understood as well the Turtle herself) cried
out--"see! see! if she does not look like a frog  stretched out" &amp; this
raised a proper laugh both in &amp; out. The Dog entered, &amp; spoke perfectly
plain &amp; distinct, &amp; with a more elegant &amp; harmonious voice I ever heard
in my life. Bears of 3 or 4 different sorts, the horse, moose, Skeletons,
spirits of departed &amp; <u>still</u> <u>living</u> <u>friends</u> entered; but none but the
latter &amp; above mentioned were to be understood by any but the conju-
ror himself. On the entering of one "that is my (<u>adopted</u>) Son" said
an Indian seated by me &amp; called out his name to which he readily
answered besides questions: this young man &amp; a girl, both living,
spoke very plain (you must observe that it is not their bodies, but their
Souls or Spirits that enter)&mdash;Children almost at the instant of birth,
Dwarfs, Giants; but this latter did make a noise indeed. We all
laughed very heartily when the horse entered; for it appears he passed too
near the Turtle who called out as the horse was flying about (in the inside)
singing &amp; rattling his rattler, "I wish you would take care of yourself &amp; <u>not</u> <u>tread</u>

"<u>tread</u> <u>on</u> <u>one</u>" in allusion to his diminutive size in comparison with that of
horse. It is somewhat surprising that every one that entered, whether he spoke plain,
or was interpreted&mdash;their First words were your lands are distressed&mdash;keep
not on the Gnd River&mdash;sickness, sickness; "but from amongst <u>ye</u><u> here</u>  I shall
select only a few aged ones" said one of the latter,  but in a <u>voice</u> no one but the
conjuror could understand&mdash;as he went out however the Conjuror paid him a most
bawdy compliment&mdash;we all laughed &amp; asked what was the matter "pah! no-
thing. I am only afraid of him said the Conj.&mdash;One of them that entered
apparently the Devil himself for he spoke &amp; acted <u>en</u> <u>veritable</u> <u>maitre</u>
startled us all a great deal &amp; enquired authoritatively &amp; angrily, "what
"want ye of me?&mdash;speake? "&mdash;Upon several hurried enquiries put
to him he said that some things I saw &amp; heard in my house this win-
ter, were by Mr Frobisher, who expired so dreadfully in 1819&mdash;"he
"is a skeleton (Pah-kack); &amp; it is he who built <u>this</u> house&mdash;he comes
"to see"&mdash;!!! Tho' I did certainly both hear &amp; see, several times this winter,
&amp; once in particular, about 2.a.m. yet I do not feel much inclined to add
faith to this assertion of Davy's&mdash;I must have something more substantial.
But I am much inclined to doubt master Davy's assertions &amp; consider <u>this</u> &amp; several others
of his sayings at former Periods in the same light as those he delivered at many of
Grecian temples; for I have every substantial reason to consider him as the same identical Gen-
tleman: however, a short time hence will decide: The Turtle said we should
have a good deal of rain; but not a <u>very</u> <u>great</u> <u>deal</u> &amp; a very hi wind, &amp; as soon as
the Sun should appear, "at its setting an indian (naming him by a very extraor-
dinary &amp; bawdy features in his <u>person</u>) should arrive &amp; bring us meat; <u>but</u> <u>this</u>
<u>you</u> <u>will</u> <u>eat</u> <u>of</u> <u>course</u>,<u> &amp;</u> <u>I shall go</u> <u>without</u>"&mdash;{"Beware of yourselves&mdash;Tomorrow
night you shall drink &amp; be drunk: drink &amp; leave the house as soon as you
"can; <u>for</u> <b><u>there</u></b> <b><u>are</u></b> <u>from</u> <u>that</u> <u>wind</u> (by which he designated the <u>South</u>)
"<u>who</u> <u>if</u> <u>they</u> <u>drink</u> <u>with</u> <u>ye</u>, <u>ye</u> <u>shall</u> <u>become</u> <u>pitiful</u>" alluding to two
blackguard half breed brothers, who proud of the bravery of their deceased father are
ever &amp; anon insulting &amp; domineering over the other indians: it is worthy of remark
that an aged man in the course of this last winter was advertised of the Same, &amp;
repeatedly pressed not to drink at the house on their accord}. This is now
the 6<u>th</u> (June) the Sun appears, but the wind is very hi, &amp; we have frequent
showers of rain &amp; snow.&mdash;About midnight the Conjuror addressed me &amp;
asked if I wished to see any of <u>them</u> (the Spirits)&mdash;I accepted the offer &amp; thrust
my head underneath, &amp; being upon my back I looked up &amp; near the top
observed a light as of a Star in a Cloudy night about 1 1/2in. long &amp; 1 broad; tho'

tho' dim, yet perfectly distinct. Tho' <u>they</u> <b><u>all</u></b> appear as lights, some larger &amp; others smaller,
this one was denominated the Fisher Star; the name by which they designate the Plough, I
believe <u>we</u> call it, or Great Bear, from the supposed resemblance it bears to that animal,
the fisher. When I was entering, several of the Indians on the outside called out
to the Spirits "Gently! Gently! It is our Chief who wishes to see ye:&mdash;do
"him no evil" &amp;c.&mdash;I had my apprehensions. A little after one P.M. one of
my men looked in, with several Indians, &amp; saw several small lights about
as large as the Thumb nail. A few minutes before 2 P.M. being day light
they gave another shaking to the frame &amp; made their exit.
	The above is an account of only a small part, for I am too much pressed
for time&mdash;I cannot therefore enter into particulars, nor a larger detail; nor give
you my opinion further than a few words. I am fully convinced, as much so
as that I am in existance, that Spirits of some kind did really &amp; virtually
enter  some truly terrific, but others again quite of a different character.&mdash;
I cannot enter into a detail  by comparisons from ancient &amp; more modern history,
but I found the consonance, analogy, resemblance, affinity, or whatever
it may be termed so great, so conspicuous that I verily beleive I shall never
forget the impressions of that evening; but above all things that sticks most
forcibly in my mind is the unbound Gratitude we owe, &amp; ought to shew,
every instant of our existance to that almighty Power that deigned to sacrifice
his only Son for us for our Salvation! Oh my God! let me never for-
get this!&mdash;&amp; teach me to thank thee not only with my lips
but with every action of my life! x x x x x x x x &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;
	Here I must close &amp; in a few minutes Seal up this for your peru-
sal, sincerely wishing I may find an opportunity, safe, of conveying it
to you&mdash;How earnestly I wish Rob<u>t</u> had been present &amp; understood
the language&mdash;This would convince the most skeptic.&mdash;
